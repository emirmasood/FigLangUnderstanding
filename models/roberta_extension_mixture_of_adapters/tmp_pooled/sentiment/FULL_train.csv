Initially I thought the flavour was n't as strong as what I like, but towards the end of the meal, I found it to be just right for the portion as any stronger and I probably wo n't be able to finish it. The chips are good too, crispy on the outside, soft in the middle, though it was a bit plain and not really seasoned. Overall it pretty good, would try again next time.","Got the momo burger for under <num>. I really like the meaty flavour of the patty. It savoury, slightly sweet, and flavours are really nice.

7590,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions. Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits. A hidden gem indeed, awaiting a more memorable encore. # WakefieldCafeExperience # AffordableEats","Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions.

The place has n't changed in that time, in terms of decor and food. Had plenty of tables inside, outside, upstairs, downstairs, with tables on the balconies overlooking the harbour and boardwalk. A menagerie of people frequent the place, so you'll see a diverse group of people. Inside has a rustic charm and when we walked in, the queue behind me, continued outside. In saying that, the queue dropped very quickly and our food came in a timely manner. For those that do n't like seafood, there are other options. Drink options are non-alcoholic or alcoholic depending on your preference. Suggest you grab the menu while you're in the queue and if you're with a group find a table and take menus with you, decide what you want then go order. If you want your food done a certain way, let them know, they're very accommodating and You wo n't be disappointed.","The last time I went here was when I was on holiday in <num>. 8years later I returned yesterday as a resident of Perth.

It a very good deal and the restaurant was full when we arrived so it clearly popular. There was a great atmosphere buzzing with happy diners and drinkers. Service was a bit slow but friendly and our rump steaks were a little overcooked. When we ordered, we were asked how we wanted them cooked so we asked what the chef would suggest and were told this would be medium rare which we agreed to, but they were more medium to well done. This was not a massive problem as the meat was good quality, not fatty and very tasty. We did n't complain but our waitress asked how everything was so we told her. What was really good was that the manager came straight over and offered to bring out new steaks for us but we were hungry( we waited around 50 mins already) so said we eat them but he did offer us a complimentary dessert which was very much appreciated. The cheese platter we selected was delicious and absolutely huge so more than enough for us to share. All in all, it was a lovely midweek treat that we found to be good value so we definitely come back again / recommend to friends and family.

It was also nice and warm inside despite being January and very chilly outside. Overall it's a fantastic place to come swimming with the family, it would be 5 stars although some of lockers were damaged and there are n't many family changing cubicles so you have to queue up and wait for one to become available.

Cumin forward on the flavour profile( quite dominant). Whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet-Bhuna is a dry curry and I wish it was n't served drowned in gravy. Maybe this is what other customers prefer-I like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid. The naan was a little disappointing, lacking the smoky tandoor flavour I'm used to, and there was n't a pronounced garlic flavour. Service-absolutely lovely.

My companion had waffles and a mango smoothie . the waffle( looked like store bought) and was very dry and crumbly. There was a small smear of cream and a few lines of syrup over them adorned with maybe one strawberry. The mango smoothie had NO mango taste whatsoever they did try to rectify by adding more mango but still no flavour . maybe they should taste their mango mix. Overall a bad experience at this place which is a shame because the motel is great."
764,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"It's not the best kebabs in the world but it's the best in Dalby for sure. For some reason every kebab shop here wraps their kebabs in foil before pressing them which means the actual tortilla wrap part does n't get cooked and seal shut properly so they can fall apart on you if you're not careful when eating them. However Ace uses thicker tortilla wraps so they do hold together better than other places in dalby. However I do miss the real good kebabs from other towns where they get pressed first and then put in packaging so the kebab is actually cooked and sealed shut. Still I love kebabs so I tolerate it here and as I said, Ace is the best you'll get in Dalby","It's not the best kebabs in the world but it's the best in Dalby for sure.

Loved the atmosphere it like industrial / western, lots of American style decor earthy tones and very cozy We got Brisket, cheesey kransky, chicken, Mac n chees and Big Mac Fries BRISKET: was on point. Tender, juicy with perfect bark and smoke ring. Could be me but I like a more seasoned rub. Smokey but coulda used a bit more bite, salt n pepper. At this point in my American bbq food journey I after a truly outstanding brisket to give out the 5 star rating. CHICKEN: tender and held a decent moisture. Great flavours of the rub made it through the skin and to the meat. CHEESEY KRANSKY: The winner of day. This kransky had the best snap of any kransky I ever had. Amazing flavour profile and perfectly juicy. Great bite to it. MAC N CHEESE: pretty basic flavour profile and sauce. Still looking for the perfect mac n cheese BIG MAC LOADED FRIES: lovely dry n flavoured burnt ends to cut through the fries. Sauce and lettuce added a pretty accurate flavour to the dish being homaged. Overall we were very happy with B Town BBQ experience.

From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken  tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality. And with the added incentive of a 50 % discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt, there's even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight.","The culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary.

This hotel is located just opposite to van Heusen in Kp road. Since dosa alone did nt go well, they have added few more cuisines. How ever that are n't that good either. Of course their onion uthappam and falooda were great but signature menus including dosa were not so good. Really do nt know if kothu parotta will be cooked with boiled eggs instead of raw ones. I personally liked the taste. Overall I was hoping it would be worth a 3 star but it can not exceed a 2. The ambience is good when we were dining.

6475,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over 30 of food for home delivery. It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'. Please note this is not about McDonalds overall; just this specific outlet. I do n't think we'll opt to use it again, but I doubt they care about that anyway.","By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over <num> of food for home delivery.

Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary. The back is quite pleasing on the eye. I can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer. Best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving.

Going on recommendations from over a year ago I booked. The service was good no complaints there but the food was very sub standard. The starters were ok and the crispy duck was fine. However cutting it up directly outside a toilet is a no no! This I never knew about until I got home and was told. If I had known it would have been sent back. All the mains were tasteless undercooked or overcooked unless your a sugar fanatic this place is not for you. Very disappointed indeed.

820,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"The food here is decent and so is the environment. Generally everything I had here has been good but in this review I be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day. The prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than I prefer. Personally I like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour, but that just me. The prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though. The steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked. The meat was n't as warm as I liked and the caramelised onions were n't as flavoursome as they looked to be. Overall you could n't taste much else and the sandwich( 22 I think) was only half a sandwich. Would have liked the whole thing for that price. The chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain. Tasted like there was n't any seasoning at all on them. A jug of lemon-lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better. Will have to write another review the next time I visit.","The food here is decent and so is the environment.

The food was quite dry and especially the muffin it was rock hard, I ate half and then gave it too the dog it was too hard to eat. I think the food needs to be thrown out if it sitting there too long. It also took an awkward amount of time for someone to acknowledge the fact I even walked in. I could see your busy but even a nod of the head would do. I just felt the atmosphere was loud and overstimulating, and if you do n't like that then this place is n't for you.

People are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters. We ordered from a menu in Chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food. Despite the reputation of the Sichuan region of China I must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way. One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate. Food is actually abundant, well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in. I recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent Cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon.","Went for an early dinner during the week.

With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future.

Two of us eating one will literally enjoy almost anything he's fed and neither of us really liked any of what we ordered because of the sauce. The mushrooms, prawns and fried chicken all had this sauce that had a golden syrup type flavour. It's a real shame because the mushrooms were incredible as were the prawns but they were ruined by the sauce. We were going to stay for a main, but we're nervous that sauce would be on the main as well( it was n't on the gyozas and they were absolutely lovely but again, the sauce it did come with was a little odd). Edamame was underdone. Would have given five stars except for that strange sauce. It all looked delicious too.","Grat decor, cute booths. Menu looks good.

Unfortunately sat downstairs at our last visit which does n't h gave quite the same atmosphere as a smaller room and more brightly lit although it is quieter so easier to converse. We also went for a couple of the set pieces and with a table for 4 there was very little room for the elaborate but sizeable presentation pieces and so some of the effect lost as we had to clear stand on their arrival in order to accommodate the dishes.

There is plenty of seating available( however more could be shaded) and with the edition of the public barbecues it's a location where just about everyone will enjoy. The toilets are clean and well maintained and the skatepark / bike tracks offer something for the older kids to enjoy too. It's quite evident that the council has invested considerable time and money into this location.

Mutter paneer was average but will try other punjabi dishes. Went there recently and the prices have increased but the quality of service has declined, we were sitting idle for 20mins and no one came to take order, there was hardly any waiter mostly just one. Tried the Mango shake which was great last time but pathetic this time. At first it was all sugary with less pulp we complained and send it back the waiter came with a new one but even that was nt great. So will avoid in future even for pavbhaji there are better options available.","Visited two times and the south indian dishes, veg thali and pav bhaji were great, puri plate only for 40rs and best mango Milkshake.

So I ordered it with ham( there is an option for bacon that costs extra). When it was served it looked like bacon and we worked up the courage to query it. They said that's just what the ham option looks like. I know it's shaped like sliced ham, but it tasted exactly like bacon. It was crispy and very salty, and sadly it was mostly left on my plate at the end. So if you want the bacon flavour at no extra cost, just get the ham.

My recent visit to this quaint bakery left me with an overwhelmingly positive impression, and I am eager to share my experience. The moment I stepped through the door, the aroma of freshly baked treats enveloped me, creating an immediate sense of warmth and comfort. The display cases, adorned with an array of meticulously crafted pastries, cakes, and bread, showcased the bakery commitment to both artistry and quality. The variety of options available was impressive, catering to a diverse range of tastes. From classic croissants to innovative cupcakes, each item seemed like a work of edible art. What stood out was the evident attention to detail  the perfect layers of a mille-feuille, the glossy finish on the fruit tarts, and the precision in every icing swirl. I opted for a selection of pastries and was delighted by the explosion of flavors with each bite. The freshness of the ingredients was unmistakable, and it was evident that the bakers at Bharat bakery take pride in sourcing high-quality components for their creations. In conclusion, Bharat bakery is a gem in the heart of Ranchi, offering not just baked goods but a genuine experience for the senses. Whether you're stopping by for a quick indulgence or seeking the perfect dessert for a special occasion, this bakery delivers on both taste and presentation.

But thanks to it, the food and drinks were served very quickly and the waiters took care of us well. We had scallops and sweet potato fries for appetizers and sides first, beef tacos and chicken quesadilla for the main, and the churros for dessert. Everything was so tasty and the portion was huge which I recommend sharing with friends or family. However I got food poisoning from the scallops, I felt my stomach was weird after eating at first, and then I was throwing up after approximately 3 hours of eating until the next morning. I had a high fever and my throat hurt the next few days( probably I got norovirus). my friend was completely fine so I guess my stomach is sensitive.

More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg. Do yourself a favour, go around the block and take advantage of Maccas or Hungry Jacks. At least you know what you will get there.","Wow, what an experience.

I do n't know whether this review reflects all Toby Carvery restaurants, or whether this is just applicable to Lincoln, but we wo n't be in a hurry to return to Toby Carvery, when there are so many eating establishment that offer true "" value for money ""."

Peter dealt with my need for seating for both myself and my personal assistant / essential companion quickly and easily and knew my assistant would require entry alongside me. When there everything was fairly organised although Peter must have thought otherwise as we were given a round of drinks on the house for having to wait a little bit. The view was great and the seats were comfortable. As an ambulant disabled person, I would n't hesitate to return to the Empire to see a gig and look forward to attending in the future.

It was n't the hairs and fluff in the sink, or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception, but, the hairs in the bed! At reception l apologised for complaining, but said l could n't sleep in a dirty bed.

However, l did n't even get that far, due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs, photos attached.

So, l returned to the second floor, where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air! The toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working, as the others would not flush.

The food itself was n't particularly great, especially on the first evening, although, in fairness, lunch on both days, was much better. To finish it all off, this morning a few people found their cars had been broken into, windows smashed, vehicles damaged, overnight in the car park.

894,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding.","My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him.

I would have liked it to be a bit more spicier. So if you like your spice then this is the one, they had so many options to choose from too. All in all we enjoyed the food and we will be back to try some of the other dishes and noodle boxes! The place was very clean and loads of seating. The deco was modern and not too in your face.

6463,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019. The price was also I felt too high, our bill came in at 77, which if it had been more like 50 I would have been perfectly happy.","A bit overpriced, but still tasty.

3112,sentiment,1,en-IN,Google,"A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises. I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.","A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises.

7851,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"Been here many times and this review should be 5 stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ? The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of "" scruffy "" experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.","Been here many times and this review should be <num> stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ?

True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir.

Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature.

There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian. This theatre really has scope to get improved, but has not made any improvements recently. The snacks inside this theatre is not that much great. You get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips, popcorn and egg puffs. When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience).

Located at the top of Cambridge St, it is only round the corner from another Wetherspoons, the Wather Works. Benjamin Huntsman was notable for this steel producing town as he invented crucible or cast steel & he opened a plant in Sheffield around 1740. The building is rather interesting inside with itsl industrial elements & overly large pipework. Two coffee machines on the lower floor along with an accesible toilet located to the rear. Other toilets are on the second floor up a staircase-note at the time of visiting, the ladies toilets only flushed if you press both buttons at the same time.

Contradictory to their policy, they were not checking vaccine cards. Tables were very close together, and the place was crowded. No dividers were in place. Not everyone would have a problem with all of this, but we felt a little uneasy, given the omicron outbreak. Overall i recommend.","Food was good.

Seventeen pounds for two double gins and lemonade when you can buy the bottle for the amount we had( we only had three or four of that) and it was a little painful to pay that price but it is what it is. We liked the reserved area and enjoyed all the free goodies they gave us and the staff were lovely.

The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates.

7310,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,What a great venue for a gig. We went to watch the ZUTONS here Situated in what looks like an old trading yard. It's got a funky Carribbean vibe with a great outdoor area for some fantastic street food and seating. A few indoor booths for keeping the rain off. A tidy venue for live music and I hope it keeps getting well supported to keep live music alive. Beer was priced fairly with reds stripe at 5 a pint. The staff were really friendly. The bouncers could do with some improvement they came across as arrogant and a little aggressive. If you do n't expect the Ritz and expect a funky friendly Carribbean live music and street food venue then you wo n't go wrong. Thanks for a top night.,What a great venue for a gig.

I know that some cocktails are short, but this one was REALLY short. In the picture attached, you can see the tiny glasses with the single massive ice cube each in them. Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff / service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do! But, as a hospitality worker myself, a bit too pricey to be worth it for a long stay, considering the products.

The parking is located offsite which feels very unsafe due to unhoused neighbours. Once you finally make the 5-10 minute walk back to the hotel, it is another 10 minutes to your room. When you have severe asthma this is not ideal. I wish the parking situation was a lot more clear at the point of check out. I would have reconsidered the location. In the event of an emergency( fire) the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building! The evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand. Both bed side lamps are faulty and almost zapped me when I turned the first one on. To top it all off 2 x dogs are located in the apartment below which bark every time you go out on the balcony. Not the 5 star stay I was hoping for. The room however is large and clean and the best part of the whole experience. Would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. For the price you pay and rating it has on other websites I am incredibly disappointed.","Very surprised and disappointed upon arrival compared to what you read on the internet.

My wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order, and the options become quite limited wherever we go.

There are a lot of Muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses, but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff. Would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal.

7139,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"This us a very old building with floors, staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old. On entering there is a bar on either side of the lobby that looks like a furniture shop. There was no one at the reception desk as she was chatting tk a bar man next door! Keys were given in an envelope but nothing else. We had to go back down 3 flights of stairs to find out the Wi-Fi code and also when breakfast was served. The room was very pretty but was not the one promised, we had a view of the kitchen vents / ducts which were quite noisy. Bed very comfortable, still and sparkling water and range of teas on tap. We were woken by rave music, very loud underneath our room that lasted for about 30 minutes. On telling reception she informed us that the kitchen does not have a sound system so it could not have been them. Breakfast room was a rabbit Warren away from where we were told, three members of staff, one being the initial receptionist were there. She appeared in the same dress as the day before but with tights that were ripped and laddered over both thighs. We sat and waited and then had to ask the youngest young lady if we could have some drinks, she was not confident at all and had to ask the other waitress if that was OK, no other was taken until we asked the waitress( who was busy doing most of the work) eventually we had our breakfast and it was good. Unfortunately others voting in afterwards were not so lucky and had cold tea and coffee served, no fruit salad or bowls and long waits for any attention. I would not stay again.","This us a very old building with floors, staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old.

The only issue I noticed throughout the night was that everyone in the restaurant that had ordered pizza was waiting for their meals for a while, which was really annoying because most people came with their partners, so whoever ordered pasta would get that first, and then whoever ordered pizza would get it 10mins later-which defeats the purpose of eating together at a restaurant. Meals should always be served at the same time. The drinks were really nice!

Service is incredibly slow, food arrives barely warm and glasses arrive dirty. You'd expect that for a place with stars( currently November 2023), that the food would be great too. With a menu that is heavily aimed towards their' signature' hanging kebabs, you'd at least expect them to be good. Honestly, they were the driest kebabs I've ever had, apart from the one time I tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager. Haha. The pictures really appear more juicy than they are. The chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just.. cold. Really not good enough for the price they charge. Looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails( 80 % ice) and are also waiting for too long for their meals. A table behind me of just 4 guests had to ask twice where their food was, with 10 minute intervals. Oh and the rocket was barely fresh at all.

Sad to say my egg and lettuce sandwich was rather overpriced with thick, bland bread, not much filling, no ? mayo and just blaah. Hubby salad and ham wrap was better. All up, we enjoyed our outing here, and would try it again next time in town."

This place is worth the visit just for the atmosphere, friendly service, surrounds and interesting menu.

Would have liked some chilli on it too  after all, Indonesian food with no chilli ? I had a delightful, special late lunch here, which was so atmospheric too.

I went for lunch and had a few starters plus a delicious Salt & Pepper Tofu with crispy noodles and vermicelli. The restaurant is also very clean and staff very polite. I personally do n't like places where there is loud music but I understand it's the norm mainly in these kind of restaurants specialised in cocktails. Despite that, there were few families with children and elderly people who were enjoying having their meals.","Very nice place if you want to enjoy anything from breakfast, lunch or dinner meals to just cocktails.

Was really looking forward to trying for the first time as I love schwarma, was sadly lacking unfortunately, chips were under cooked both tikka and tandoori tasted the same and were dry as sticks as was the' schwarma' which was just flavoured chicken fillets. Luckily I ordered an extra garlic sauce as none came with the kebab and the salad was basic, no cabbage. The wrap that came with the kebab was beautiful though. Pizza was OK but nothing special, plus the schwarma had an overwhelming taste of cinnamon which did not go with pizza.

Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n't see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n't think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n't risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n't quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n't hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more. There are other local Afternoon Teas that blow this out of the water.","As a Christmas gift, my wife and I went for an Afternoon Tea.

Toilets: yes, they were clean Parking: plenty of slots for a car with a trailer. A reasonable amount of parking for regular vehicles. Playground: yes. It was small, but there was enough equipment to keep most kids happy. Next to the park is a skate park, where there are older children and teens. Picnic tables: there are a few scattered around, but come early in the day if you want to snag one. Boat launch: small to medium-sized craft can get to the river here. Ramp is a bit of bitumen, stone and cement, from what I could guess. We launched a kayak from here, without damaging it.","We went to this park because of access to the Nerang River.

The Eggs Benedict and the other food all looked amazing-quality ingredients and well presented on the plate.

The beetroot latte sounded interesting. Service was friendly. Beware of the European wasps out the back which go for your food / sugary drinks and buzz around you. We moved inside and thankfully they did n't follow us. I would like to suggest they get an exterminator to find and kill the nearby nest of this aggressive, introduced species of wasp.

I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant, with a great ambient atmosphere. We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n't take long and the restaurant was ' buzzing ', it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n't order again. The gravy was far too thin / watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n't want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n't make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n't fault it.

7182,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers. Come on management, get your thinking cap on.","My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for <num> years.

Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers. Come on management, get your thinking cap on."

It's a special lively place to hang out and enjoy real entertainment at a fraction of the price you would pay in the West End to see some really famous good performance. Ambience, food, drinks etc is lovely. I wish there was a pick and mix on the menu of finger food as I as well as my friends are n't always up for eating heavy based meals. Overall lovely and there is also a comedy club. I had my husband private 40th birthday in the comedy area and it was really lovely. Few pics from Eric Benet performance on.

The fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of KFC, which is quite an accomplishment. The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it. I hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future.","I recently visited Al Baik fried chicken restaurant and overall, I had a satisfying experience.

We dined romali rotti and fried rice with peri peri alfam; it was good. However, the rice was too oily, and the drinking glasses were not cleaned properly. Even though they can accommodate more than fifty people at a time for dining, they do not have a sufficient parking area.

At first, I went in and walked back out after assuming it was shut as there was no staff around, and the whole building was empty with no music, etc. I walked around outside and spoke with a mate who said it should be open and went to try again after 20 minutes. There was a staff on the counter who looked grumpy and not welcoming, but I still ordered my burger meal. Whilst waiting, I could hear some staff at the back being loud and noisy playing about, but I just ignored it, and then they started to play music on their phones. There were no other customers until I left, but the tables were not clean. I sat on one table that was slightly clean to eat when my food was ready thinking this Jesters chunky chicken fillet meal would be great but after a few bites I knew this was a mistake, bland flavour, a few slice of shredded lettuce( nothing else) and literally a pinch of burger sauce. I would not recommend this place to anyone with how it's run.","I went in to Jesters for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon after a quick visit to Dewsbury. What a mistake.

Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours.

I did get a refund for the food only, but never got offered a replacement or a full refund for all the meals due to the quality of service. Observe the pictures and judge for yourself. This needs to improve in my opinion as the town is now becoming a hotspot for dining and has a buzz. Merry Christmas Wetherspoons"

Although the restaurant was packed full they were able to get us a small table for two at lunch rush, however there was a slight wait for our order. Again this was around 1 pm and the place was bustling so, to be expected. Value for money, we got 2 burgers, a mocha, and a cold drink for 60. Little bit steep for a cafe style restaurant but there are plenty of options. Nice atmosphere, located in a little alley which gets some sun, lots of greenery around and the heaters certainly kept out the cool winter chill.","Stopped here for lunch and enjoyed a big burger and coffee, the food was good, though the burger probably had a little bit too much sauce.

I only mention it because I do n't know if this was a one time occurrence or if it's common, here, but they were BUSY, not just sitting around ignoring us. Our bill was somehow lost as well. We patiently waited, understanding that they were obviously getting slammed with customers, and we mentioned nothing, and still the girl who came over to find / settle our bill insisted on taking drinks off of our bill for the wait, which was so very kind of her.

Free WiFi worked well. One of two lifts was not working, but this is n't an issue when it's quiet. Also had a small issue with the shower head not locking at a good angle, but nothing too major. Noise from the town can be heard in a quiet room, but it calms down at a reasonable hour for sleep.

Waited on by Daniel, a very friendly & helpful staff member who took our order. The Mushroom Al Forno starters were lovely and arrived hot. Our mains, Lasagne & Pollo Cacciatore were equally as hot and very flavoursome. Apart from the initial problem upon entrance the visit was very much enjoyed and we would visit again. I would recommend to park in the Houndshill carpark if driving here as it is situated right next to Bella so perfect placement. Great food and essentially hot! * Update Dec' 23. Visited again while on a Xmas break. Had the mushroom Al Forno starter again but this time it was a disappointingly smaller portion than in July when we last visited. Ordered the lasagne as Bella IS the best but when it arrived it looked horrendous. The dish had burn marks all over it and the lasagne itself was as flat as a pancake! Not acceptable and certainly not the usual quality I receive. I called the waitress over, Karolina could not apologise enough and without excuses took my burnt dish away and 10 minutes later returned, again apologised and served me with a fresh, hot, bubbling and delicious lasange. That was much appreciated. Great service. Thank you Karolina","Visited while staying in Blackpool for <num> nights and pre-booked our table a few days in advance for <num> pm.

The picture quality was really good with good brightness level. I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film.

Apparently their Chicken & Leek Frittatas are absolutely amazing, and hefty sized great looking Caesar Salad delicious also. The Frittatas and Mini( muffin sized) Quiche were each( alone, with no side salad), nice looking foccacias each. Latte & Soy Latte were both of extremely good quality, strong, tasteful cuppas. Would call again, will be trying their huge Caesar Salad next time, at only! The menu had a couple of lesser prices on it, than current prices. Specials board behind the counter. Also offering healthy, tasty and beautifully presented smoothies. Simple, FREE and easy angle parking adjacent to St Georges Square, alternatively 15 minute kerbside parking right outside the door! Convenient location, easy to stop and grab a cuppa on your way to work or wherever. Phone box across the Street. Outside dining options, lovely frontage, prime location, easily accessible to all.

Main courses were great and fairly priced-lamb cooked to perfection, enough of potato and veg( delicious dauphinois), generous portion of seabass and tasty prawns. The only disappointment was the scallops-would like to see a more elevated and sophisticated dish. On previous visit had the chowder and mackerel pate which were both delicious. The interior is quite rustic and not to our taste so do n't let it put you off as it did for us previously.","Second time visiting <num> Mussel Row and overall pleasant experience.

7003,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"Was my friends 21st birthday yesterday. His parents booked him a table at Cosmos Sheffield, invited family from Portugal and a few close friends. We were 21 in total. The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in / out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:- it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it! Thr manager was rude and definitely not helpful at all! All he wanted was us all sat eating quietly, out money and goodbye! Horrible experience!

Room was decent size, warm, clean and the bed was comfy. Shower was easy to use, and a good temperature. Enjoyed the two slides of cake available to go with a cup of tea. Only downside for the room was the radiator( or something else) that was making cloud clicking noises all night, making it really hard to sleep.

The cons: the kids' milkshake bottle was more than half with foam, the cooler drink was more ice than actual juices advertised-which after a few sips became almost tasteless, very small portion of fries for the price very little toppings, mac and cheese was no cheese sauce.

The burgers were nice, nothing bad to say about it; the chilly hot dog was very nice, I do recommend it and the girls there were lovely. The cons: the kids' milkshake bottle was more than half with foam, the cooler drink was more ice than actual juices advertised-which after a few sips became almost tasteless, very small portion of fries for the price very little toppings, mac and cheese was no cheese sauce.

Ticket is for 100rs for adults and 50rs for children below 12 yrs of age. There is a waiting area with many seats near the ticket counter where we have to wait after buying the ticket. Once there were close to 20 to 25 people, we are escorted by the guide inside who is a fort staff. We do not have to pay separately to guide. Fort is beautiful with amazing artwork. Many movies including Manikarnika has been shot here. Musuem is also good. Seperate ticket is needed to visit museum. Just outside the museum, a local painter has a shop. We bought couple of painting. He sells good paintings at a very reasonable price. Must visit place.","Intriguing and beautiful fort. Neat and clean without any pigeon or bats nuisance.

We sent it back for a replacement and amazingly the new one came out the same!! They did take it off the bill! Finally there was a small piece of wrapping plastic in my brothers dinner! We alerted them to this but the waiter basically ignored it and nothing was further said or done by them! There must be other restaurants to visit in Poole and therefore I would probably avoid. We certainly will not be going back.,Visited here <num> evenings ago with <num> others. Whilst the food generally tasted ok there were several disconcerting issues!

Sure, the seats are comfy, but it's incredibly overpriced and the screens are rather small compared to other cinemas. Often rather cold in screens and a lack of atmosphere due to hardly anyone going to the cinema. Also a lack of screens and variety in what they show. Keep an eye out, so often they will advertise a film or have posters up, and that film wo n't actually show in the cinema. Strange. Staff are nice. Popcorn is often stale and bland.

We've had afternoon teas before, but from other places at similar cost, and you usually get a small selection of bite size cakes / sweet treats each.

Wait times have massively increased, my last order I was waiting 2 hours. Food quality is also down hill. My most recent order, the pizza was very burnt and charging 4 for stuffed crust when they might have well as not put cheese in it with the amount they used. Definitely not worth 4. It upsetting that they cooked my pizza, looked at it and decided that this is the quality they want to serve. I also had plenty of cold food lately. It a shame because when they get it right the food is amazing, but they just are n't getting it right enough lately.

With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n't like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n't underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms.

The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again.

As at Burdwan town itself has 3 or 4 branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream.

Because we all know the quality of food products. All are quality products. I can review the branches of the shop. As at Burdwan town itself has <num> or <num> branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream.

The food well with that money I have spend was n't worth it for me the burger was ok the chips honestly looks from a frozen bag not even taste fresh potatoes very poor the chicken wings again looks like been cook from a day before and just been reheated if was n't for the sauce it wo n't give a taste as they was so dry and tasteless. Do I recommend well I do if you are passing by and want to watch a game ? And have a drink but to eat there no really for me and they money to spend there is no worth it

From hot dogs to chicken burgers, tandoori chicken-style pizzas and delicious French fries, Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes. The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish, the chilli paneer pizza, which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite, which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu. While the food impresses, the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch.

Walking in the front there was no visible timetable, you had to wander over to concessions and await a timed board to hit the movie you wanted to see. Worse, three times I went by in my weeks in Edinburgh, the right shutter was kept shut. One can only guess if this is mechanical failure or just lack of trying at this point. Ocean Terminal generally gives the vibe of having given up, and it feels this cinema has, too. Shame, as it used to be a really fun place to go.","Honestly, the place just looked uncared for.

The typical Thai food on the menu is great, but we wanted to experiment so oopted for the grilled squid, chicken salad and pad kra pow. All extremely delicious! Only thing I disliked was that the staff abruptly asked us to adhere to a strict 90 minute reservation, so we had to leave at sharp( we arrived at 6 pm). Wish I could stay for longer and try more food!","Really nice dining experience, long waiting lines so do n't forget to make reservations in advance.

Chips were a mixture of freshly cooked and warm ups fish was as hard as rock and totally tasteless so had obviously been sitting in the warmer for a very long time. They got the order wrong and gave us two fish, no fishcake. All in all a very disappointing meal for 30.

The menu offers a variety of gourmet pizzas, including vegetarian options. Although the selection is relatively small, I often find myself torn between choices due to the diverse array of high-quality ingredients. Occasionally, they feature a special of the day, although it not available every day. On the dessert front, the tiramisu is good, though not as standout as the pizza, and it on the smaller side. While I did n't try the coffee, I notice the young server craft a cappuccino for a colleague, and it looked quite nice. The restaurant is quite small, which adds to its charm, but may be challenging to find seating, especially during weekends.

I start with the only positive thing I can remember about this unforgettable experience( for all the wrong reasons), the decor and interior was to a high standard. The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our 27 and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them.","A friend and I visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on Instagram as well as some recommendations.

The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately <num> or <num> tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our <num> and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them."

I have not removed a beautiful lasagne topping as you would expect there simply was n't one. Nor have I mixed it up its genuinely how it arrived. It was n't sheets of lasagne, mince and beshmal sauce topped with melted cheese. It was simply mushed up pasta sheets and mince with burnt corners and hard over done bits of pasta. It was just about edible but a massive shame not particularly the most flavoursome either. It was very basic. I was expecting a lot more in terms of presentation and quality the reviews I've seen have heard fantastic things about this place but this was a massive disappointment. I never leave negative feedback and this is n't. It's simply an honest review of what I was given. It would be great to see the feedback taken on board and a genuine lasagne being introduced to their menu.","Such a shame was expecting something fantastic.

I enjoyed the carrot and red lentil soup, vegan Oxford breakfast, and fruit scone. Given that the vegan breakfast is the same price as the non vegan one and has food taken out(, eggs, sausage), I felt like it could have included more of the beans and veggies. My portion of beans was just a handful of beans. But flavor wise it was delicious. Especially the bread! Their homemade scone was also fantastic. Drink-wise I tried their teas and chai latte and did not find them great. Service is friendly but unhurried. Prepare to wait to order, and if you in a hurry, avoid lunch, especially around noon.","Lovely little nook in the basement of an old church.

4228,sentiment,1,en-IN,Google,"The Sir Mark Cubbon statue in Bangalore, set within the verdant expanse of Cubbon Park, is a historical monument dedicated to Sir Mark Cubbon, the British Commissioner of Mysore from 1834 to 1861. His tenure is often remembered for the administrative reforms and infrastructural development he brought to the region, significantly influencing the city layout and public administration system. The statue commemorates his contributions to Bangalore, serving as a bridge between the past and present. Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history. Although opinions on colonial figures are complex and varied, the presence of the Sir Mark Cubbon statue provides an opportunity for reflection on the layers of Bangalore history, offering insights into the forces that shaped the city. This monument stands not just as a piece of art, but as a historical marker that prompts discussions about legacy, governance, and the impact of colonial rule in India.","The Sir Mark Cubbon statue in Bangalore, set within the verdant expanse of Cubbon Park, is a historical monument dedicated to Sir Mark Cubbon, the British Commissioner of Mysore from <num> to <num>.

Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly. Finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid 7 for the cookie and a total of 55 for not a great product. Could have been and did expect a mich better overall experience at Neighbourhood today. I am debating about going back.... I think one more attempt is warranted.","First time at Neighbourhood today.

6211,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene! I visited with my wife the second time, we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries, which came to. We wo n't be back.","I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice.

The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex. Further to this, it our little girl enjoyed it so much that she cried when she left so it is appealing to kids.","Alright, I have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding Superbowl in Barnsley but in fairness I think some are a little harsh to say the least.

Our waiter would n't leave us alone and we got urged to order about three times before we finally did.

In my opinion, if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public, you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process: that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation. We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.
If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.
I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.
I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.
Isn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?","Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.

Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.
As part of the government's December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the ""core skills occupations list"".
Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as ""targeted for consultation"", rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.
A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was ""bizarre"" given the industry's ""mammoth task"" of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.
In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages ""would be a failure"".
""Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,"" Wawn said on Tuesday.
""Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the'maybe' list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.""
A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O'Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final ""core skills occupations list"".
""Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,"" the spokesperson said.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.
Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.
""\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,"" she said.
""There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.""
Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government's target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.
In December, O'Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but ""we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships"".
However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.","**PAYWALL:** Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.

2136,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.
""You actually can't have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn't begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,"" says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.
The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"".
To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.
""They're like, 'We can't get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people',"" says Huntley.
It's not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.
Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.
Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being ""swamped by Asians"". Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being ""swamped by Muslims"".
In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were ""out of control"".
""Was I right?"" she asked her fellow senators. ""You'd never admit it, but yes I was,"" she said.
It's hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.
It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is agood thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia's immigration intake.
Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.
Lowe was president of the country's pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10years until 2014.
During that time, he tells*The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to ""prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure"". The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be ""taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment"".
""Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer  The boost to government budgets is enormous.""
So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today  as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.
Meanwhile, Australia's population is on track to grow to about 40 million people  an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane  by 2060.","Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living.

1143,sentiment,1,en-AU,Reddit,"One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world's third-largest population of sheep  behind China and India  but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don't have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems' capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.
The Coalition's usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country's transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.
A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow  ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn't rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?
The battery strategy sets out a ""vision"" over the next decade, in which Australia becomes ""a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition"".
We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers' know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!
The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.
Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated  note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.
Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.
There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.
The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.
The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.
Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.
Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.","One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add.

If the numbers have reduced in recent years it's probably because they're being listed on Facebook marketplace instead which doesn't cost you anything and is likely more effective.

There's nothing illegal to my knowledge about the for sale sign unless it's defecting the car like blocking the windscreen or something. You do see them around though. Sometimes parked. Sometimes driving around. Saw one the other day. They're almost always older cars selling for pretty low prices. If the numbers have reduced in recent years it's probably because they're being listed on Facebook marketplace instead which doesn't cost you anything and is likely more effective.

1700,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.
The saga of Miles Morgan Australia's involvement in the ""Future Fit"" turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.
It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.
Miles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.
Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.
Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.
Miles Morgan Australia's involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.
Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.
The government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had ""a deep understanding"" of the needs and a ""strong working relationship with the Department"".
""This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department's requirements,"" the submission prepared for Colbeck says.
""This procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.""
Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an ""open tender"".
That contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.
Within months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the ""capability"" for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.","A private consulting firm handed almost $<num> million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a <num>-page final report and issued legal threats.

1014,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Lets be clear - calling out actual racism is not divisive, it is pointing out actual division. Classic conservative playbook approach to quash movements for equality.
However I feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns. Of course some people in Australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics. But for those that aren't who aren't also progressive, it is just alienating
Labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism, which IMO is usually economic inequality. People in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that (eg if you are poor, why does it make sense to vote Yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough)
In this sense, this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems. You can't let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem.
This is of course not the actual motivation of Price, who doesn't give a flying F about ordinary people when it actual comes down to it","Lets be clear - calling out actual racism is not divisive, it is pointing out actual division.

But when did you get here? It wasn't always an employer's market. Pre-covid, at least in hospitality, casual workers could leave bad work environments because they had a lot more options. Post-covid there are fewer customers, rosters are thin, and venues closing down means workers are competing for fewer jobs, and they stick around even when mistreated.
A lot of casual work is taken up by visa holders like yourself, who don't have a safety net and tend to be even more exploitable, so I'm not sure it's Australian workers who are tolerant.
I think the real question is why are exploitative employers hard to hold accountable? There's Fair Work but they seem to only go after big corporations. In Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, there's JobWatch, but they've had funding massively cut last year.
Maybe you're asking why Australians don't care enough to fund organizations that support casual workers' rights.

1657,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday's budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.
Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.
Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.
Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. ""The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,"" Ms King told the Financial Review. ""The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered."" Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those  14 small projects worth about $444 million  were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory's election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money  about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers' third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor's signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money  about $136 million  went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to ""bail out"" Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. ""It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,"" Senator McKenzie said.

4580,sentiment,0,en-IN,Reddit,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.
Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.
According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.
The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.
On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.
Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters.

In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.","Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison. Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June <num>, <num>, now faces approximately <num> months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term. Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March <num>, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake. According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities. The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January <num>, <num>, and February <num>, <num>, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section <num>(<num>) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families. On March <num>, <num>, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections <num>, <num>, <num>, <num>, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy. Mishra charged an average of Rs <num> lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not."

Storage from pumped hydro and batteries is still cheaper than the alternative now.

2384,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Not really. The gist of Michael West's article is what's known as the doctrine of command responsibility.
It comes about when senior leaders did not *order* war crimes, but they *knew or should have known* and stopped them. This applies to military leaders, of course, which is what McBride was upset about. But it applies to political leaders, too - since ultimately, in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership. 
Just think of it this way. Let's imagine that our intervention in Afghanistan had been a stunning success. Let's say that today - because of Australia's intervention - the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy. Do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit?
Of course. So - if you're to take the credit when things go well under your leadership, you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly. 
That's the doctrine of command responsibility. As the wikpedia article quotes,
>*The Prosecutor v.**Delali* first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that ""had reason to know"" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have ""had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.""
Returning to the article, a link within it,
notes that then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith was in 2012 made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days. There is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims - in fact he publicly denied them. 
The Minister for Defence is in overall control of the ADF. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, Stephen Smith may be responsible for war crimes. 
Anthony Albanese was a member of Cabinet at this time. Given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time, Albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them. However, over the period of ALP government 2007-13 he held a variety of roles (including Deputy PM under Rudd), and so it would be arguable when, where or whether he could be held responsible. Nonetheless he was a member of a government where the ADF was suspected to be committing war crimes, and the government rejected action on this.","Not really.

The population for 2 years has been saying to do something about immigration/cost of living. They havent gotten on the front foot and shown they are doing something. 
A bit like ScoMos fire blunder. Cost of living was a major issue and he had The Voice. That died down and he stopped tradies from coming and ramped up immigration. They had a big argument over some minor changes to taxes that everyone wanted indexed anyway. He was given benefit of the doubt and now he has come out with a inflationary budget. People are saying when is he going to do something about cost of living.
Im not saying he doesnt care or he isnt doing anything. Im talking about the spin. He needs to recover the frame that he is the one to be voted in to handle cost of living. Thats always going to be a little tough for the ALP due to peoples perception as the LNP being better at managing the books. But him leaving it for so long hasnt given people confidence. He is running out of time. Because now anything that takes more than a year like essential infrastructure to improve housing supply is too late.
Now he is done with another budget. So he only has the one just before the election left which is too late. 
Dutton has come out with a major decrease to immigration which a lot of the public perceive as being a silver bullet to cost of living (I dont personally agree). That has really put Albo on the back foot.
As I said with no budget until just before the next election he doesnt have much of a chance to reset the publics perception. The media will keep piling on with the landlord/private jet/out of touch stuff and Dutton will keep quiet. QLD a major swing state also has a crime problem and an ex police Qlder will probably do well.
I still think Albo can win a majority but he needs something big to turn it around. Like a bushfire/refugee boats/covid that can be used politically to readjust perceptions.

1378,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"The article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people.
Direct democracy can't fail to achieve the good of the majority, although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason. I was going to include compassion, however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end: it's part of the wisdom in ""do unto others as you would have others do unto you"".
However, direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out. Nothing is perfect, but better is more useful than worse or the same.
Therefore, I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy, to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment; along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it; basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum; and reduced working hours to allow them to participate.
Freedom of speech, not freedom of action, needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings. Speech has no meaning in itself, only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action, which is why it needs to be free. Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver, not the speaker: the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech, especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech.
As for being hateful or hurtful to feelings, feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out, within each individual person, outside of the control of a speaker. Whilst a speaker's intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda, those emotions are created by the recipient, for good or ill, as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party. We are not our brothers keeper.
It is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions, with reason, so that they don't take action that becomes the source of objective harm. Speech is not action or cause of action: that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech, internally as well as externally.","The article fails to discuss the one form of democracy that operates for the greater good and that is direct democracy where all the people govern all the people.

People seem to value their time more than their life on the road. The number of helmetless degenerates on bikes that ride past cops in Pune is appalling.

Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).
Edit: I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes:non-lethal snakes for a few different countries here. Australia ain't so bad.","This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.

1529,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.
Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.
Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.
The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.
The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.
It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.
The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.
Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it?

2148,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program  the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.""
How this number was calculated, he didn't say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.
There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia's borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.
According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia's record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.
But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan's deputy director of migration and labour markets, ""asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it's a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.""
Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, ""it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.
""Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.""
With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton's proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.
What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.
This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.
In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.
When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.
""In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost  numbers,"" says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. ""Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.
""The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,"" says Rizvi.
The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government's shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.
In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, ""Scott Morrison told students to just go home,"" says Honeywood.
""That caused incredible damage to Australia's reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.","He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program the Coalition would free up almost <num> additional homes in the first year.

1 The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.
2 Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.
3 Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost 
Lot of other things as well","It isn't always about a sense of pride. It is more about the market and what make sense economically.

Australia's level of immigration has been far too high for several years without any commensurate expansion in infrastructure. Everyone settles in Melbourne or Sydney.

During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.
My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 
Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 
We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 
And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 
Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.
Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up.

Nobody's walking <num>.5km to stand at a bus stop in the sun or rain for a bus that comes once every <num> minutes and is often late or cancelled so they can then walk <num>.5km at the other end. They'll just drive instead, if they can possibly afford it. Even with the much better trains in Melbourne, they're often late or cancelled due to trackworks, whether building new tracks and stations or fixing up old lines. You can't plan, ""Let's visit the city this weekend and go to Vic Market,"" you might find yourself taking a <num> minute bus journey instead of a <num>' train journey, and falling over every time the overcrowded bus lurches to a stop or swings around a corner."

The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but, as outrageous as the anti-Israel stand is, it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government. When allowed to get close to the levers of power  as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government, and with a balance-of-power position in the federal Senate today  theGreens are exposedfor the wreckers they are.
The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy  most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups  has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation's environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.
Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government's corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.
The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government's wider agenda.

For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression.

There's no metric on what qualifies as a'racist' country or not; but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation.
The treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre 1901
The fact the first Federal Parliament passed the White Australia Policy, a blatantly racist law which remained in law for 70 years, the majority of Australia's existence up until this time
The practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation's existence (again up until the 70s)
Fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today.
Different legislation for those living in indigenous communities (like NT alcohol laws) 
On a non political level (as her comment didn't specifically mention politics only):
The vast vast majority of commercial TV and media featuring white faces. Today 1 out of 5 Australians are of Asian heritage (there's more Australians of Asian heritage than Americans of black or Latino heritage) but you wouldn't know it from watching Australian TV.
The national character and story being almost exclusively from a white Anglo Saxon perspective, with only fleeting mentions of a vague'multiculturalism'.
News media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite.
News media egging on race riots like Cronulla.
Tingle is right, racism is a big part of the Australian story. Australia may not be as racist as other nations, and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments.

Recently, I saw something about someone in Egypt who made ceramic tiles. Once, these tiles used to grace the walls of palaces and now they are a souvenir sitting on the desk of someone 5000kms away. Culture is not bad, these are what made us who we are, and in India people have a hard time letting go. Because that is also a culture. Of Course not in every family."

The NSW Coalition's most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a ""dereliction of duty"" after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.
In an extraordinary move, Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government's new laws, which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders, would pass without consultation.
The changes follow a string of high-profile alleged domestic violence offences, including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month.
Shadow attorney-general Alister Henskens said the Coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by Thursday.

The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens, the shadow attorney-general, argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws. He later said he had seen the government's press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.
Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor's laws.
However, Henskens' push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.
Greenwich said he had been in parliament for ""five premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments"", and he had never seen a proposal with ""such disrespect to stakeholders in this space"".
""I've never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don't want to consult with them,"" Greenwich said.
""They want to rubber stamp something they haven't ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.""
Leong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.
She said Henskens' attempts to ram through the bill smacked of ""relevance deprivation"".
Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.
""The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,"" Hoenig said.
Attorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that ""all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state"".
Domestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be ""considered properly"" before being passed.
On Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.
At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.
There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender's release in the Supreme Court.
A requirement for magistrates and judges to consider ""red flag"" behaviour such as animal cruelty, stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced, while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families.","Paywall The NSW Coalition's most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a ""dereliction of duty"" after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.

1265,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"TL:DR 
Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 
Centrelink are useless. 
Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum's advocate. 
I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It's a nightmare!
Here are my pro-tips!
*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 
From memory it cost about $3500. 
They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 
*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 
You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 
Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 
I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 
I've just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let's not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 
*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 
Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it's surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 
Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 
Be your mum's advocate. That's the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It's enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 
That said, I've found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced.

I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge.

I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.
The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it. If not, they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be, and the fact that they are usually shown to be (to all practical purposes) immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem.","This is really about the reputation of the police.

We had universities long before they were here, and it used to work. We generated world class thinkers, scientists, workers, and inventors. I feel like there is a middle ground between only Lords and higher class going to uni like in the past, and millions of people getting stupid degrees in useless shit that we all have to pay for. Let's dial it back a bit towards teaching topics that require the university degree to perform. Then move out towards degrees that help with critical thinking and abstract thought, which can still help with generating ideas and new ways of working. If money and spaces are so limited, we need to go back to using universities as a step into future work, not just a standard thing that everyone does before they get an unrelated job. That might get spending under control."

It seems to be small band aid fixes like ""hey, let's restrict opiate pain meds for everyone, that'll solve some shit"" without looking at a lot of core issues. So many factors. Health care. Income. Stress. Housing factors. Familial issues. Education. It's so multifaceted."

On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.
""It's time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,"" he said.
Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.
""It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally  Israel  to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,"" Mr Leeser told The Australian. ""But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?"" ""This is not an environmental party,"" he said.

'What is Adam Bandt advocating for?': Labor MP questions Greens leader's announcement
Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.
Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not ""just a symbolic move.""
""It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,"" he said. ""It is a concrete step towards peace.""
""As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition."" Mr Bandt said the ""scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.""
""A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.""
He warned that a ""human engineered famine"" was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that ""amounts to collective punishment of these people.""
Mr Bandt said that Labor's credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you ""recognise just one side.""
""Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,"" he said. ""Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu."" Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting'un-Australian values'
Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.
""Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,"" Mr Watts said..
""Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,"" he said.
""Wedge politics only divides the community,"" he said. ""Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution  but the Greens aren't serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.""
""On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,"" he said. ""Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.""
But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. ""We see no role for them in this,"" he said. ""A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel's security.""
""We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority  We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.""
Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. 'End the occupation': Greens Leader calls for Labor to'take action' against Israel
""This motion  sends the message that Hamas' violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,"" he said. ""This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.""
He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women's rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the ""cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.""
Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had ""become a central plank of Green philosophy.""
""The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October  even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,"" he said. ""They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.""
Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC's Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.
Reflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed ""how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.""","NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the ""unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government.""

In VIC I was shocked when I had to pay some unnecessary third party a fee to book an appointment on some dodgy web site that could've been slapped together by a high school student for a project. Vote against privatisation wherever you can. Resist it. It's never good."

 The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector. It is not. It is a powerful, cashed-up lobby group promoting the interests of wind, water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in Australia.
Last month, the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards, airport lounges and lifts in prime Sydney and Melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking Australia's future. It is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the Coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election.
Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix. Intermittent, disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid. Gas also would be a crucial part of the mix, principally because of its agility to ramp up or down, compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources.
Yet the renewables sector has bought none of it. It regards the election of a Coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight. Implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out. It would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory.
""It is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt  not just temporarily, but for good,"" wrote Giles Parkinson, the editor of Renew Economy, the sector's equivalent of the China Daily.
Giles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions, network capacity, connection delays, social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition.
At the end of the week, the announcement that the NSW government would pay Origin up to $225m to keep the Eraring Power Station operating for two years beyond its planned 2025 retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal. The Victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with EnergyAustralia, the owner of Yallourn, and AGL, which operates Loy Yong A. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system. The theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited.
The Australian Energy Market Operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next 10 years, named somewhat optimistically as the Statement of Opportunities. AEMO said it had been advised of ""numerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects"", meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between 2025 and 2028.
This would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events, or blackouts as most people would call them. It gets worse. The new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate Bowen anticipated 18 months ago, and they need to get connected to the grid. Building 10,000km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected. Planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget.
There is no good news for Bowen or the sector in the AEMO report. Project EnergyConnect, the interconnection between NSW and South Australia, was regarded as the most straightforward high-voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory. Yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until July 2027 at the earliest. That will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the Torrens Island B and Osborne power stations shut. In NSW, delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected, and Victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission.
Even if we accept AEMO's optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline, this is hardly the fast-track transition the government promised. In October 2022, Bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government's 82 per cent clean electricity target by 2030 would require the installation of 22,000 solar panels a day, 62 million in total, by the end of the decade. It would require a 7-megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every 18 hours, each as high as Crown's One Barangaroo tower in Sydney. About 10,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines would be needed to link up the vastly expanded network.","Paywall The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector.

1011,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**""
Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.""","**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**"" Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.

2290,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.
Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"".
""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else.""
Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.
Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.
In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling.
""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?""
In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.
""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said.
In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.
In October 2022, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.
Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation.
Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.
Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.
""It wasn't a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister's office, and the pain of it hasn't gone away.""
""They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they're doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,"" says Dabboussy.","Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about <num> Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

5472,sentiment,1,en-IN,Reddit,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.","OP. Here is my take on this.

Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.
The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.
Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.","Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste.

Lake Mountain doesn't have any downhill skiing - cross country only (as well as snow play). It's also very low in altitude so unreliable for conditions - if you wanted to to go there to see snow you'd have to keep an eye on the weather and conditions as it may well be sloppy or bare.
Baw Baw can get decent snow but it's a very small area with short lifts and trails. It would be cheaper than Buller so there's that. I've never been there so can't say much more.
My favourite option in Victoria is Falls Creek - IMO it has the best variety of terrain, the best views, the best conditions, and less queues than Buller. However it is too far for a day trip. For 2 nights though I'd say it's worth it going to Falls Creek. It might be hard and/or expensive to get accommodation at this late stage though. Definitely worth the extra distance though if it's possible. 
Finally - if your visitors are coming from overseas, I'd question if going skiing here is really something they want to do here. If they're coming from a country where they already ski, it's unlikely to be better here. And if not, it's likely they can travel and ski somewhere where it will be cheaper and better than it is here. I'm not saying absolutely not to ski here - I do most years and enjoy it - but there's probably better uses of their time and money in Australia. I only ski here because I live here and that makes it easy.","Out of the options you listed, Buller is the clear pick.

Criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that 5000% differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk.
I like the New Zealand approach. The government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year. Eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers. The price of the tobacco is reasonable and so there is no market for the criminal gangs to make a profit with illegally important tobacco.
Both schemes achieve the same thing . The Australian approach is really quite dumb, compared to the New Zealand approach.","Just make the tobacco the same price as in Europe.

2604,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.
Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry's services.
Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a ""limited-term contract"" in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads' licensing and registration arms  a deal due to expire in the 2060s.
The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was ""hoping to close any deal by the end of the year"".
A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria's bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.
A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.
""It can probably be done better,"" the minister said.
The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.
Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.
Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.
""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.""
The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.
Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.
The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.
Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.
But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.
Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.
Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.
""Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.""
Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"".
""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security  cybersecurity in particular  could quite quickly run into trouble.
""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.""
Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.
The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report.
The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.
It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.
The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.
Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.
The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.
Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.
When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.
""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time.
""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.""
The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria's coffers.
Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.
However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next 40 years.","The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.

Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered. Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership. ""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services."" The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership. Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $<num> billion by June <num>. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $<num> billion in the May <num> state budget. The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $<num> billion by June <num>. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $<num> million daily interest bill. Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below <num> per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt. But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service. Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed. Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria. ""Daniel Andrews campaigned in <num> against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying."" Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"". ""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security cybersecurity in particular could quite quickly run into trouble. ""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost."" Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $<num> in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were <num> registered births in Victoria last year, <num> marriages and <num> deaths. The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June <num> last year was $<num> million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report. The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the <num>-<num> financial year. It took the agency, on average, <num> days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the <num> months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than <num> days. The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $<num> on January. Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December <num>. The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for <num> years under a $<num> billion deal in <num> and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in <num> for more than $<num> billion. Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model. When VicRoads was partly privatised in <num>, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation. ""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time. ""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets."" The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $<num> billion into Victoria's coffers. Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs. However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next <num> years."

I'm not sure that there are many extra responsibilities I can take on. I've worked for my current company for over half my working life and I've worked in every department, including a stint as a supervisor that lasted for just over a year. 
I love to learn new things, and I think that's part of the reason I'm so desperate to get out, I feel like I've hit a brick wall of all that I can learn. That and the managers are kinda impossible to deal with currently. This is also combined with how shitty people are post COVID. Which is why I don't want to just get a similar job in another company. I want to get out of retail all together.
Working in the companies head office would be ideal as it's a part of the company I haven't worked in yet, but unfortunately it's located in Melbourne. 
I've got a mortgage that I share with someone and am responsible for helping take care of an elderly family member. So relocating is not possible with my current circumstances.
My brother says my issue is that I don't talk up the skills I have enough, and your reply kinda reinforced that that is something that is definitely needed. So I might pass my resume around to different family members before I do my next bulk apply.","Hey. Thanks for the reply. It's nice to know you can get out. Hopefully I can find something as well.

-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.
-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 
- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 
-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 
I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 
My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don't use it to date, it's frowned upon but once you get out there you'll meet people anyway.

I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least 72 hours in advance. The only exception was if  someone called in sick. The Idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call.","I've got friends from the US, Canada and France that also commented on how prevalent it was here.

Like I worked <num> hours last financial year but because it wasn't <num> hrs a day <num> days a week, every week I don't get permanent. Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee. The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than <num> years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care. I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least <num> hours in advance. The only exception was if someone called in sick. The Idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call."

8719,sentiment,0,en-UK,Reddit,"The thing about Brexit is that it lets you hypothetically do a bunch of stuff that you can't do in the EU, like control migration, intervene to support heavy industry, and be a lot more explicit in insulting the French.
When Labour aren't campaigning to rejoin the EU, they can effectively attack the Government on their failure to do what they promised and what people wanted. When they campaign to rejoin the EU, the position flips, and the Conservatives can again make the argument to do all the stuff that they aren't actually doing. 
The far more sensible strategy is to win power, demonstrate to left behind voters that the government is actually committed to helping them and can be trusted, and then explain why rejoining would offer this better than remaining outside.
Unfortunately, that requires a lot of work. A lot of remainers care enough to tweet, but get quite bored at the prospect of actually coming up with a good solution for the parts of the country they don't actually give a shit about.","The thing about Brexit is that it lets you hypothetically do a bunch of stuff that you can't do in the EU, like control migration, intervene to support heavy industry, and be a lot more explicit in insulting the French.

2217,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!
Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.
So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.
The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).
This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.
Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 
It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.
Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 
There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.
So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.","Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!

Back when I was a young'un, many moons ago, my ex and I had a paper map of Vic and loads of time on our hands. One of us would close our eyes, point to a random spot, and we'd go there Sometimes we saw interesting stuff, sometimes not, but the base method was sound. A few of those, then you get a feel for what you like, what you can afford and what your car can handle. Then you spread your range. From Melbourne, I've driven as far west as Adelaide, as far north west as Broken Hill and as far North as Brisbane. All of them had their high points. Go for it and enjoy! Definitely get RACV roadside assist though, it's reciprocal in all the states I've been to and has saved my hide more than once!"

1. Spam public housing everywhere, like, literally everywhere, enough to cut wait list down to a minimal amount of time. And/or
2. Protect renters, right now we treat them like dirt, if we protect them there will be a bunch of long term renters which reduces demand to buy, and therefore lower prices
Problem is, either or both of these will be viciously attacked by the media, the right wing pollies, and the ones who currently own assets (just look at poor bill who tried a gentle touch removal of negative gearing). Opinions will need to sway a lot more for any of this to happen.","The solutions are all there plain as day but the government won't do it as they are political suicide. <num>.
