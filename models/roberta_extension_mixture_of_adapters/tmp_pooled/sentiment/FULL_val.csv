Hubby is dairy intolerant and their allergen menu is accessible through a qr code. You tap in what your are allergic to and it hides menu items that are off the list. He was quite impressed with this. Unfortunately had to drop a star for food this time. I ordered buttermilk fried chicken it was huge( see pic) and had a weird curry taste. Now wondering if actually they served me the wrong thing. Two flat coated breasts arrived, I took one home for the dog and the paper towel in the box was stained yellow! Hubby fishfinger sandwich looked great but was bland.","I've really enjoyed a couple of visits on my own before. Had halloumi fries then and loved it.

No complaints whatsoever there. But after that, no one was interested in us. Seemed that most, not all, of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners. Friends ? Local celebrity ? The restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service. Decided against a dessert and figured it would be too much trouble to get a coffee so we paid and left. Wo n't go back. Shame really because the food and the restaurant itself are great.

I would suggest asking for a table away from the front door if possible. We had some really lovely food, the menu has are real range of options for every one and some great vegan options. I was really happy with the Vegan Lasagne and the dessert was the highlight. The only downside I would say is that you constantly have Uber eats / Delivery Drivers coming through the restaurant that are pushing past you at the table, alongside leaving the door open so when your seated near the front door your constantly getting cold so having to get up to close the door. It definitely ruins the atmosphere when you trying to enjoy your meal.","We came here on Thursday around <num> pm. It was fairly busy, but we thankfully booked so did n't have to wait long.

873,sentiment,0,en-AU,Google,"I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. 1. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. 2. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. 3. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes. The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions were notably small, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent. Overall, while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant, the food quality, particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes, did not meet expectations. The pricing, coupled with the small portions, further detracted from the overall dining experience. I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers.","I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. <num>. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. <num>. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. <num>. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes.

When I was served, I ordered a coffee and was bluntly told they did n't accept dirty keep cups( I had made a coffee at home when leaving). I understand it is not ideal having a dirty cup, but the way it was handled, in a rude, blunt tone was not good customer service. I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion.","Not a pleasant visit which was disappointing.

The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion."

While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n't receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station. I left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions, poor service and difficult technology. I hope Burger King can work out these kinks because I believe there is an opportunity to improve.","I had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night When I went to order at the counter, the staff told me to use the self-service kiosks instead.

6367,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant. This was the first time to Hearth after hearing good things and seeing the positive reviews. It was also a nostalgia trip, being an avid diner in Studio cafe back in the 90s when a student at the Art College in Hull in my youth. The restaurant has a simple, stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine. It also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff. We were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen. The service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks, but the main course food service was fairly slow. We decided on 2 courses and waited 45 minutes after ordering for our mains, which did seem too long. Desserts arrived much quicker, within 10 minutes The food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food( which seems to be the new bar set for Michelin guide rated food these days... as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society). Portions are generous, and Sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful. A special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion' pudding', which was deemed' the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside. The only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food, as all savoury courses and gravy did seem VERY salty. We would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating. Also, identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff, when ordering or any mention. For example, one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the( enormous) yorkshire pudding, and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free. Which was confirmed. Desserts were excellent, with interesting menu choices, and, again, generous portions. We would return, as the overall experience was enjoyable, but maybe to try the evening menu next time..","We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant.

What is different in the Poha here is it contains pieces of fried batata( potatoes). There are 2 options-normal for RS 10 and special for RS 15. Not much difference except shev is sprinkled on the Poha and a spoon is given in the special varient. Otherwise both are served on pieces of newspapers with masala sprinkled on them. Good for a normal breakfast for Poha lovers but nothing much exclusive, especially compared to the hype of the place in the city.

We had pizza which was nice but the crust was bland, it did n't have that Italian pizza crust flavour, we got fries and they were under cooked and hard in the middle so we left them and told the staff but still got charged for them.

Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance ","I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to.

As a vegetarian, I can say that the food was good, but the only one that wowed me was the pizza, which was made fresh in front of everyone. Service was excellent, and I watched them give that same service to everyone. Cash only, which was a bit weird but not too much of an annoyance in the centre of town.","Overall, it was a good experience that I'd recommend for doubles to families with kids.

The secret weapon was the mysterious and alluring Salsa Verde sauce, served on the side like a daring sidekick ready to take on any culinary challenge! Speaking of challenges, I faced the flat white quest next. It was acceptable, though it lacked a bit of magic. Still, it played well with the avocado toast, so we'll call it a breakfast truce!

The space inside the bakery is a cozy hug; think of it as breakfast in a warm embrace! However, if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats, you'll have to roll the dice with the weather. Outdoor seating is a fair-weather friend, but when it cooperates, it's a treat! Attention parents, mini-humans are welcome here!

It was not busy either but the staff were all standing and joking paying no attention to customers or bothering to clear up. The order of 2 ice creams and a frozen drink took 10 mins. Although we had paid for a large drink it was half full. It took over 5 minutes for my wife to be served despite several members of staff looking at her. The attitude was then poor. The baked that is supposed to the lost the manager and supervisor was empty. It clear there is absolutely no leadership here and no are as to whether a customer gets a decent service. When I comments to my wife 2 other customers both sitting nearby said they were also disgusted with the staff attitude etc we have photos and will be sending these to the master franchisee of McDonalds in Australia.,THE worst McDonalds we have ever been to anywhere in the world.

Their fluffy hotcakes were beautifully plated with fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, edible flowers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was topped with a generous amount of custard which made the hot cakes a tad too sweet for my liking. The malteser shake could not be finished as it was too sweet for my liking. The chilli scrambled eggs were savoury and perfectly seasoned. It is really delightful to pair those eggs with sliced avocado and slightly toasted sourdough. It was overall an enjoyable experience.

6902,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.","I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance.

Once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table. We ordered from the app; the drinks and food arrived promptly after. The pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate. It was generously topped as well and tasted good. The fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons. Overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes. The only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance( maybe they should move the smoking area)!,Update: have been a few times now and the food has n't been up scratch.

It was our first time at this particular Tim Hortons, I've never been to any Tim full stop so this was my first experience. When we arrived it was busy but not rammed, there was a queue for food' collection' which was awkwardly set up as there's not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there's a table in the way of collection also. So that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which I'm adamant does n't work in food places but they keep doing it. They could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some McDonald do but I digress. As we'd never been we used the self serve to figure out what we'd like and the menu were clear and simple, but it was so we could go and order in person as I have a blue light card. The man said Tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal / offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that. The food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer. I got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious. Thanks to the deal, for 2 meals it cost us just under 15. All in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend.

Now, I'll caveat this by saying that it seemed exceptionally busy for a Wednesday lunchtime, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked what the wait time for food would be. I did n't do this, and we ended up waiting for around 35 minutes after we'd been seated. I ordered the Badgers Beef Burger and my son the buttermilk chicken burger. Both meals come with a side of your choice. I got chunky chips, my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce. The beef burger was nice, but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry, though a mayo style dip is provided on the side. No complaints on the chicken burger from my son! The atmosphere in the bar is really nice though and the menu is extensive and well curated with a mix of traditional and contemporary meals and small plates on offer. The music playlist was right up my street, mostly well known and loved 90s and early 00s hits!","Badgers Bar & Restaurant has over <num> Google Maps reviews and a great star rating, so my son and I decided to head here for lunch during our trip to Derry / Londonderry today.

The whole thing needs a massive shake up but of course that won't happen because people are terrified of acknowledging the issues within the education system, let alone actually doing something about said issues.
Rant over, I've been pissed about all of this since I finished high school nearly ten years ago lol","Definitely, it's bizarre. I live near McKinnon but am in the Glen Eira College zone and the socioeconomic demographics between the two areas are pretty much identical but McKinnon is seen as something to aspire to while Glen Eira is (generally) seen as ""good enough"".

2660,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. 
I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.
I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.
Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 
As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.
If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?
Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.","Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW; the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place.

Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.
I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 
We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 
The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize.

2221,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 
I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is ""Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance"" and has ""consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art"" costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 
A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn't it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn't throwing away stock. 
Perhaps I'm over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don't know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 
I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don't know what I'm talking about a I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that's as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I'm definitely not a customer of yours and I don't really care what the cost of a coffee is. I'm simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that's hardly the case now.","I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge?

1708,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.

Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.","You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain.

1390,sentiment,1,en-AU,Reddit,"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:
Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.
Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.
Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.
Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.
Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.
Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.
Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).
Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.
So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:
Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)
Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)
Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.
Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.
However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:
NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle
QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon
SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 
TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay
VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale
WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay
There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.","Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here: Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously).

Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think). Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being <num> minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney. So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around: Perth (tour of general suburban coastline) Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety) Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than <num> minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments. Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful. However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within <num> minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state: NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find."

Yeah, every single person I know who has ever been a chef reached that point. It's just a shitty job - the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time. Working when you should be on a break.
A well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run. You could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find... You could create a good kitchen, but honestly if you're burned out and over it, then that's probably not the best option. A good manager is passionate about the job and you probably can't do that anymore. Maybe in a few years you might be able to.
If you can finish your Cert 4 easily, then absolutely do that. The piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job, maybe the one after that. It's worth having.
You could honestly do almost anything. A good mate of mine became a school teacher (they tried to get him to teach kids to cook... but he told them to fuck off. Literally dropped an F bomb in that meeting). He teaches maths and science. Doesn't have any particular aptitude for either subject, but he can read a high school textbook and that's all you really need (plus a relevant degree in teaching, obviously. He had to spend four years in university to get that - worked in a kitchen part time while studying)
Or, you could do what another mate did and move laterally - he's a hotel manager now. The hotel has a kitchen obviously, and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job, but doesn't actually work in the kitchen.
Ultimately, put your mental health first and get out of the situation you're in. You don't have to do it instantly - just start moving in that direction. You'll feel so much better once you've taken the first step, trust me. I'm in the middle of a similar transition myself (different industry though) still working the job I don't like but I won't be much longer and that's made a huge difference.",">I feel like I'm done with this industry Yeah, every single person I know who has ever been a chef reached that point.

Such a weird direction for gov to frame things. People not wanting to live in apartheid like conditions says nothing about whether there's one or two states. Calling for freedom is vague enough that people can mean allsorts by it, yet this gov chooses the'freedom =s antisemitism \[destruction of Israel\]', in rhetoric taken straight from Tel Aviv. And based on this Orwellian revisionism by Labor, shouldn't they be condemning Payman, not saying she showed guts? They can't even follow their own bs properly."

2474,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.
At the moment, the ""green hydrogen"" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue. If it's genuinely useful it doesn't need subsidies.

1741,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. ""If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.""","The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.

Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.
The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.
