"The ALP have been playing games with energy policy since the Rudd years, they're just using it as a wedge for social democracy, the goal has always been to destabilise the LNP in wealthy inner-city seats. Listen to what they got away at the last election, they ""won the argument"" by convincing the gullible public that all you had to do was vote for one party over another in order to have more cheap green energy, at no cost to anyone (that includes taxpayers and consumers) and they did this without providing any real policy detail or proper costings. If anyone dared to question this false argument, they were labelled either a ""denier"" of climate change or were subject to ridicule for not understanding the benefits of renewable energy. 
These arguments are extremely clever, at the end of the day, the ALP is a ruthless political machine, and Bowen and co and experienced and professional politicians. They skillfully framed the ""climate change"" debate as a political argument, and they won that argument comprehensively. Yet here we are, 2 years down the track and facing the prospect of blackouts, you can't make this stuff up.",1,0,0.004040137864649296,en-AU,Reddit,TRAIN_en-UK,TEST_FULL
