"Ordered first time ever, takeaway delivered which was on time. Customer Service by phone was good. Marinara found it dry and bland, so this did n't go down well. Pizza base was so much like dry bread. Toppings were reasonable though. The Penne Napolitana good serve tub but again, found it quite dry and bland. The Napoli sauce was claggy like a dry paste, so that did n't go down well. The chicken souvlaki was a very good decent serve. It actually tasted really good and flavourful! So far, I would only recommend the chicken souvlaki.",0,1,0.9998475313186646,en-AU,Google,TRAIN_en-UK,TEST_FULL

"I dropped out of my science degree, so I'm personally a bad example LOL. But because I was part of a Science cohort, and now work at the uni I dropped out of, I happen to have a lot of Science uni friends. 
I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 
Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.
My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 
My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 
A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD).",1,0,0.00015539121523033828,en-AU,Reddit,Google,TEST_FULL
"It's not Original Tea day. Most of the items do not have stock mentioned in the menu. I ordered Plain Maggie and Lime soda. They did n't use Maggie, instead of that they used some other noodles. The taste was not good. I ordered lime soda but gave Lime juice in a small glass. Lime juice was good.",1,0,0.0001661360147409141,en-IN,Google,Google,TEST_FULL
"At the Woolies I work at I always pack bags unless :
- the customer does not have their own bags and does not wish to buy a bag
- the customer has their own bags but has said they would like to pack it themselves. Or they ignored me asking if they would like me to pack their bags and are still holding them, then I assume they intend to pack it themselves 
- the customer has a really big shop and is still loading the belt and hasn't given me the bags yet, in this case I will start scanning some stuff through to make more room on the belt for them and then bag the items I've scanned once they give me their bags
I'm assuming this is the same for Cole's to, but unless you have told them otherwise an employee should be packing your bags when you go through a manned register",1,0,0.00016874074935913086,en-AU,Reddit,Google,TEST_FULL
"The food we ordered for dinner was normal jeera rice and dal tadka and paneer makhanwala. They were prepared with simplicity of home and tasted just like I d like it at home. Calming. Kind of the food that makes you happy and content. They can work better on their atmosphere as everything presently felt very gloomy. However well curated the articles may have been decorated, there seemed no particular fashion it followed and hence a poor interest in interior design. However the food again, I d like to recommend very strongly. Priced nominal and tastes and quality super.",0,1,0.9998218417167664,en-IN,Google,TRAIN_en-UK,TEST_FULL

"Nice place to spend quality time with family or friends. A lot of space to walk around and amphitheatre is there. Play area for kids is very nice with different types of slides and swings as per age group. Restaurant is there with fast food to full meal on card, food quality is ok but service is poor and is little bit expensive as far as quality is concerned.",0,1,0.9998003840446472,en-IN,Google,TRAIN_en-AU,TEST_FULL

"Definitely one should visit this restaurant! Calm place neat and clean well decorated kind gestures of the people there ordered chicken noodles. Adequate quantity was there. tasty food. The chicken pieces in noodles were delicious. price was very reasonable. X Food was tasty but felt a little bit extra spicy. Spicy amount should be less as not everyone is comfortable with it. X As I asked for sause, they gave very less amount of sause in a small glass. Should have given a ketchup / sauce bottle. X waiting time was a lot. Felt like they preferred to make food for the online deliveries first, then they gave us. Take the negative points as feedback Overall I loved the place!",0,1,0.999785840511322,en-IN,Google,TRAIN_en-UK,TEST_FULL
Budget friendly hotel. The cleanliness is basic. Good for a quick stay. Ac rooms are on the first floor. There is no lift and need to use the stairs. The bed quality is very basic.,0,1,0.9997829794883728,en-IN,Google,TRAIN_en-AU,TEST_FULL
