Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction."

Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:"

I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service / delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n't a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n't make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n't want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough.

Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho.

The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 
Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 
Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked.

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.
My advice is that don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.
It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.
Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.
The analogy I'd use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box. What's in the box? It could be an empty box or full of lead weights. How could I ever know? You need to tell me. I sure as heck don't want the person carrying the box to hurt themselves and need back surgery.

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""
Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as ""inconsistent"" with Direction 99.

It isn't the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late, but it's good to see this get raised by the ALP as it'll probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it. 
Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well. Check out Madhuram Sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy. Enjoy!"

Even a non Ivy League college there is miles better than top nits and govt medical colleges for technical education and medical studies. 
The biggest factor is ease of getting into us colleges as compared to indian ones due to population. 
If she wants to get into pure sciences the situation is even worse. A bachelor in science in top colleges like delhi university amounts to shit(telling from experience) compared to us. 
And lastly high school. I have some friends who did their high schooling in the us. They can vouch that the quality of high school life there is a lot better. In India hardly anyone comes to school in 11th and 12th standards in science stream as all are going coaching for competitive exams for most part of the day. It breaks kids.

Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.

Cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe. Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7.

During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional. From the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality, it's clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences. Whether you're craving traditional favorites or eager to explore new culinary horizons, Chikaros is sure to delight your senses and leave you coming back for more."

Lovely servers and lovely atmosphere, however, every time I happen to go in there, the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients. All times I have been, my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them. For example, my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie. When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances. For example, I'm lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options.

Really tasty chicken and the chasni sauce was very good. The pie itself was lovely and hot contents and crisp crust with not a hint of soggy bottom, which is very important. The pie maintained its structure when being ate which was excellent as nothing was spilt at all and no sauce running down the hands. The carry out containers were made of card and of a substantial quality. Highly recommend this shop and look forward to my next visit."

The Thai green curry was quite watery and thin for a curry but it was still flavorful, the fish was delicious with the mango and the spices. However, the pad Thai was only mediocre and did n't have much flavour. Overall the dishes looked nice but did n't have much flavour."

The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience."

They bring viruses and germs to untouched societies that haven't built up any immunity to those kinds of diseases, and they'll cross entire oceans just to try and erase the customs of exotic cultures from the pages of history. Just one example, and before you give me any of that ""but they do so much good"" horseshit, stop.

My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper.

It was just a reminder because people forgot and it was causing problems. In no way was it put up because people went in with vouchers and spent it all on alcohol. 
In any case this was a covid measure and only lasted a year, so it's way old news. Meal vouchers to spend in supermarkets don't exist any more. 
This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all. 
Quite a few schools pooled the meals vouchers and bought in bulk to make up food packages, so that parents got more stuff than they would have got individually.

Yesterday it was literally less than half of the bowl. I made a complaint through the app and also called the shop. There was a lady who said she was the manager first but she was nice. She asked me to send the pics and I did. The next time I called another man picked up and he said he was the manager. He said this is the standard that they always offer and that he had a look at the camera and the pic I sent and he said that the correct portion!! I did mention that never been this less before and he simply would n't acknowledge it or offer any alternative solution. He was extremely rude and that something that not characteristic of a manager of a restaurant. I have attached the pic below and let you all see for yourself if it was fair!

Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:"

I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service / delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n't a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n't make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n't want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough.

Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well. Check out Madhuram Sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy. Enjoy!"

Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7.

Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20).

The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience."

The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 
Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 
Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked.

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.
My advice is that don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.
It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.
Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.
The analogy I'd use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box. What's in the box? It could be an empty box or full of lead weights. How could I ever know? You need to tell me. I sure as heck don't want the person carrying the box to hurt themselves and need back surgery. But I'm also not likely to interrupt their work and check how heavy the box is, unless they're a new employee still being trained."

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""
Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as ""inconsistent"" with Direction 99.

It isn't the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late, but it's good to see this get raised by the ALP as it'll probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it. 
Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

The biggest factor is ease of getting into us colleges as compared to indian ones due to population.

And lastly high school. I have some friends who did their high schooling in the us. They can vouch that the quality of high school life there is a lot better.

Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.

Deport the entire Conservative party to Rwanda.
Send the Conservative party to Rwanda to enjoy their new life in the sun. If this isn't feasible, i would settle for just the Cabinet and Parliamentary Conservative party.

My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper.

Then compound the fact that motorists pay road tax, IPT on car insurance, fuel duty, VAT on fuel, council tax.  When we break the rules, we pay for speeding, bus lane violations, parking violations, etc.
How the fuck is there no money to look after the roads?  There's so many cash revenues from motorists."

This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all.

Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:"

I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service / delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n't a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n't make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n't want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough.

Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner!

Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing.

Yes, housing was famously cheap before 2022, net immigration was famously not averaging 250k under the LNP pre-covid, and the LNP had absolutely no hand in the current inflation that had been the core economic issue since late 2021 /s. 
I do agree Labor has left to much heavy lifting to the RBA RE addressing inflation, and that housing is bad (but not because of immigration, but because we favour it as an investment absurdly), but the alternative had a huge role in getting us here too, lol."

My advice is that don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.
It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.
Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.
The analogy I'd use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box. What's in the box? It could be an empty box or full of lead weights. How could I ever know? You need to tell me.

I will say no one is making the big bucks. Don't know anyone doing astrophysics though, only know of a handful of PhD students in that field, all were from relatively prestigious universities in their undergraduate, or participated in some institutional research projects prior to their PhD. 
Some anecdotal stories about my friends who are science grads.
My best friend did a double degree in Chemistry and Commerce, has always been smart and hardworking, now works for Sydney Water with a salary of $109K. 
My partner is a Forensic Science major, with skills leaning towards chemistry. I told him on our first year of dating (when we were 19 years old) that he wasn't going to find a job in that field - it's an impossible field of science to get into unless you want to get into the mess of joining the police and getting transferred. He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts. But the job is not that stressful, and he's not career ambitious. 
A handful of friends work as lab and research assistants for a full time equivelent salary of about $80K, but most of them have not been able to get full time or ongoing employment. Some are ok with this, because they are doing their research masters (and thinking about PhD)."

Mr Furnell ultimately opted to cancel the revocation of the man's visa.
The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""
Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as ""inconsistent"" with Direction 99.
Asked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a ""significant emphasis on serious offending and family violence  which need to be considered in all matters""."

It isn't the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late, but it's good to see this get raised by the ALP as it'll probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it. 
Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well.

Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale.

I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7.

I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond.

The ambience of the restaurant transports you straight to the heart of Kerala with its warm, inviting decor and traditional music that sets the perfect mood for a culinary adventure.

It a must-try for anyone visiting the restaurant. Another highlight is the Chatti Chor, a rich and aromatic biryani cooked in a traditional clay pot, which seals in all the flavors and spices, resulting in a dish that both comforting and exotic.

The organisation and service was excellent and ca n't be faulted at all, fantastic staff all round. Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20).

To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness.

The brocoli and the fries were lovely but we were both deeply disappointed with our main dishes. Both were bland, lacked seasoning, and neither tasted of seafood.

Had a Lamb Shish with rice but it was without asking served with a bowl of side salad, bulgar wheat, fresh pitta bread and the chilli sauce tasted splendid. The lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender, juicy and succulent as the last. The rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish( as opposed to just the pitta or chips) it was ' warming ' and had a gentle, buttery taste. Interior was simple, yet beautiful; a modern and classic mixed look. There even a veiled prayer booth / section at the back; now you may not pray( or be of the Islamic faith) but the addition of such a room was thoughtful-and it blended in and added to the whole ambience.

The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices.

The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more.

The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience."

My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis."

In any case this was a covid measure and only lasted a year, so it's way old news. Meal vouchers to spend in supermarkets don't exist any more. 
This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all. 
Quite a few schools pooled the meals vouchers and bought in bulk to make up food packages, so that parents got more stuff than they would have got individually.
