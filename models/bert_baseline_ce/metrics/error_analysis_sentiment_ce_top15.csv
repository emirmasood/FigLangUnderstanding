"Nice place to spend quality time with family or friends. A lot of space to walk around and amphitheatre is there. Play area for kids is very nice with different types of slides and swings as per age group. Restaurant is there with fast food to full meal on card, food quality is ok but service is poor and is little bit expensive as far as quality is concerned.",0,1,0.9999574422836304,en-IN,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL

"The food we ordered for dinner was normal jeera rice and dal tadka and paneer makhanwala. They were prepared with simplicity of home and tasted just like I d like it at home. Calming. Kind of the food that makes you happy and content. They can work better on their atmosphere as everything presently felt very gloomy. However well curated the articles may have been decorated, there seemed no particular fashion it followed and hence a poor interest in interior design. However the food again, I d like to recommend very strongly. Priced nominal and tastes and quality super.",0,1,0.9999510049819946,en-IN,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL
Budget friendly hotel. The cleanliness is basic. Good for a quick stay. Ac rooms are on the first floor. There is no lift and need to use the stairs. The bed quality is very basic.,0,1,0.9999504089355469,en-IN,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL
"An all day cafe with a fully licensed bar. Seems to serve a mixture of fusion dishes blending European and Asian influences. Tried the Big Hum Benny for breakfast-eggs Benedict on pulled Pork and a hash brown. Unfortunately the hash brown just fell apart, resulting in a plate of delicious mush. Staff seemed eager and attentive, perhaps a bit to much so.",0,1,0.999947190284729,en-AU,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL
"Ordered first time ever, takeaway delivered which was on time. Customer Service by phone was good. Marinara found it dry and bland, so this did n't go down well. Pizza base was so much like dry bread. Toppings were reasonable though. The Penne Napolitana good serve tub but again, found it quite dry and bland. The Napoli sauce was claggy like a dry paste, so that did n't go down well. The chicken souvlaki was a very good decent serve. It actually tasted really good and flavourful! So far, I would only recommend the chicken souvlaki.",0,1,0.999946117401123,en-AU,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL

"The restaurant is only just beautiful to look at. The dishes they are serving on an average. The atmosphere and ambiance are just beautiful. They are arranged dining very properly and neatly maintained. But we expect much for serving food taste. They served their Special Mutton biryani, Talassery chicken biryani butter naan and Schezwan noodles. They told Thalassery biriyani, especially mutton biryani is their special but the biriyani is not like Thalassery style only giving normal biryani named Thalassery and the price put to plus GST( high price). It's actually 3 star restaurant pricing, but the restaurant is just an Multicusine not having a three star rating still. Mutton was overcooked and already lost its texture. Biriyani masal is also In a confused state. Schezwan Noodles was the worst one. Totally disappointed. If you're wishing to spend little time with your family or partner by having some food in addition just go for it and you will get a good ambience and a calm atmosphere. Or your priority is always "" Food Exploring "" I will not recommend this restaurant. I ca n't see the washing basin space there. They will provide a hot water pot for washing hands after finishing your food( personally I do n't like that culture always, mouth washing was not possible for me on that occasion). # Roadside parking space # Both Online UPI and Card payment are also available # Wheel chair accessibility not available",1,0,5.819318175781518e-05,en-IN,Google,Google,TEST_FULL
Speed of service is average. Ordered food on the McDonald app it took approximately 5min to come to my table. Then I ordered a latte and it took roughly the same time. My latte had a small hair in it which I removed. It was at the top of the cup. Asked for sugar and milk for my drink but I received no stirrer for putting it in. I used my empty fries box to stir my milk and sugar into my latte. So 2 star for this time.,0,1,0.9999414682388306,en-UK,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL

"The food was very nice, I ordered chicken dum biryani and mint mojito which was nice. But I found the place a bit congested, and not a good decent one, being a girl I was not very comfortable, few group of boys were using abusive language management should look after all this.",1,0,6.413787923520431e-05,en-IN,Google,Google,TEST_FULL

"A very good restaurant in the centre of the city. Very reasonable price. Good quality and quantity of food. Shawarma is just wow. The best shawarma in the city. Their mayonnaise is the highlight. Tandoori chicken is too good, must try. Good service, but they take much time. Food and service are really good. It would be really great if they could maintain cleanliness.. it's actually little dirty. It's hight time that they need to change the menu card, because it's tooooooo old and dirty.. toilet is again very dirty.",0,1,0.9999350309371948,en-IN,Google,Reddit,TEST_FULL
