It's a lot harder to justify when you have:
\* project teams that move directly to the next project in the queue when their current one winds up
\* long term rollover contracts for ongoing service provision

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.

It isn't the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late, but it's good to see this get raised by the ALP as it'll probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it. 
Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

You say you are 25. You seem to be well educated. 
So just a provocation, which I would like to invite you to think about , see if it helps? 
We are conditioned to consider that the goal in life is happiness and that suffering is the lack of happiness. The world should be fair. People should be this or that.

Then the decision will become about what to sacrifice and what you may gain as a result. Again it's about taking chances and making sacrifices

In an evil world, do small acts of good for people who are less privileged

There are plenty of people with white skin who aren't English or British in London (and other parts of the UK but especially London). So the fact that you jumped straight to skin colour says a lot about who actually has an issue with it.

We have to MOT our cars to ensure roadworthyness, yet the roads themselves are the danger?  Especially for anything with two wheels.
Then compound the fact that motorists pay road tax, IPT on car insurance, fuel duty, VAT on fuel, council tax.  When we break the rules, we pay for speeding, bus lane violations, parking violations, etc.
How the fuck is there no money to look after the roads?  There's so many cash revenues from motorists.","Baffles my brain.

It was just a reminder because people forgot and it was causing problems. In no way was it put up because people went in with vouchers and spent it all on alcohol. 
In any case this was a covid measure and only lasted a year, so it's way old news. Meal vouchers to spend in supermarkets don't exist any more. 
This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all. 
Quite a few schools pooled the meals vouchers and bought in bulk to make up food packages, so that parents got more stuff than they would have got individually. 
Personally I think it's disgraceful that schools are practically the only safety net that kids have regarding nutrition, domestic violence and mental health.","This was because parents were doing their normal shop and then offering the vouchers at the end once everything had been scanned.
