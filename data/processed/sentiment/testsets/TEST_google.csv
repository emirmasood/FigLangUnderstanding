Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction.","If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, look no further than Starfish.

Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:","Positives: First time going to this place today.

1000000103,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese-style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients, no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over 45yrs. Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho.

Firstly, some ground floor rooms are abominable. Also some upper floor rooms have old window AC and old TV! Now coming to the service, the buffet breakfast is really small with about 4 items and although they claim that it starts at 7, you can not get anything before and at times even before 8! The bar is kinda not up to the standards of a family restaurant. It gives off a seedy vibe which makes it not a good place to be with one family. While the Indian food served in this place is quite delectable the Chinese food is a real horror! There's no swimming pool. Also if you want to hang out your wet clothes from a trip to the beach they do not offer a place for that. You have to go for their highly expensive laundry service instead. Also, it's located quite a bit away from Aberdeen Bazar","The place looks excellent from outside, the decor is quite cool and everything but staying there reveals the real place!

It's actually 3 star restaurant pricing, but the restaurant is just an Multicusine not having a three star rating still. Mutton was overcooked and already lost its texture.

Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well.

I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description.

Because of this, I've removed a star.

Very close to the bus station, Darwin shopping mall and other beautiful shops and cafes. It is also not far away from the train station which makes it perfect to easily catch a train.

We complained then the meal got served along with the second drink after we said we were leaving. The wait was n't great, no one explained anything until we complained. After we finished eating the very bland food, we waited another 15 minutes before our tables got cleared. This was after the waiter passed our table several times without paying any attention to us. We had already ordered dessert along with the main meal  but we still had to wait again after our main dishes had been cleared to even get that. Not sure I ever be back after this encounter that has left me feeling annoyed by everything( the service & the food). Not great at all because I had lost all my appetite by the time dessert was served.","Came here to celebrate something special. Got in at <num> pm, first drink came at which was fine.

A packed and vibrant atmosphere with attentive & friendly staff clearly please couples, groups of friends and family patrons. It has always been busy when we have dined here and booking( especially at the weekends) is a must. The burgers are OK but do not rival those of the Beefy Boys venue also in town. The spicy chicken wings are seriously hot and this may well have affected my taste buds and enjoyment of the burger, but my overall impression was that it was pretty standard in nature. Good drinks menu and calorie rich deserts make for an indulgent and satisfying end to what was a pleasant trip to this popular destination restaurant. No doubt we shall return soon.","This venue has been a welcome addition to the otherwise bland and limited offering that Shrewsbury has to offer.

The organisation and service was excellent and ca n't be faulted at all, fantastic staff all round. Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20).

To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness. Nando, charging a premium for mediocre dishes, wo n't cut it. What is happening to British hospitality ?

There's so much to look at and brilliant place to take kids with you or made a family tour because there's a lot for kids. Keep them busy for a couple of hours. I like the aquarium area, butterflies, Egyptian mummy section and many more. BTW just one lift for big massive building and couple of floors not enough. Stair case was full busy. It's free entry then why not enjoy. Superb location just in front of train station.","Been here first time but glad I made it. now, it's a great museum.

A very interesting and eclectic decor that keeps you looking around as you investigate more and more of the pictures and unique lighting fixtures, there a wonderful vibrant atmosphere with just the right level of noise from music and conversation. I decided to go for the Butchers Brunch with poached eggs, treacle-cured pork belly chop, two Cumberland sausages, smoked back bacon, house rostis, chorizo beans, buttered toasted sourdough and my husband had 6 American Pancakes with streaky bacon, blueberries and maple syrup. Everything was very tasty, all the pork products on my brunch were well cooked without being dry the pancakes were nice and fluffy. The Butches Brunch was a bit pork-heavy for my liking and could have used something to lighten it a little, perhaps grilled tomato or mushrooms to cut through all the meat and the pancakes could have the option of some yoghurt to enhance them, none the less we enjoyed our lunch very much and want to return for breakfasts or dinner soon. We were served by Max who was very friendly and attentive, always bringing a smile with him.","My husband and I decided to pop in for a spontaneous lunch and were seated promptly upstairs.

Starters of lamb chops and chicken tikka were average, but the onion bhajis were really good. Mains were where things got really good. The lamb lababdaar was fantastic with a very good chicken tikka dish and saag paneer. Rice and naan were nice but the portions were a little on the small side.

We found ourselves prioritising the brocoli and fries which was noted by the attentive staff. How a plate of clams and pasta can taste of nothing was beyond my imagination for such a highly rated restaurant."

Was greeted immediately and I knew what I wanted already. Had a Lamb Shish with rice but it was without asking served with a bowl of side salad, bulgar wheat, fresh pitta bread and the chilli sauce tasted splendid. The lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender, juicy and succulent as the last. The rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish( as opposed to just the pitta or chips) it was ' warming ' and had a gentle, buttery taste. Interior was simple, yet beautiful; a modern and classic mixed look. There even a veiled prayer booth / section at the back; now you may not pray( or be of the Islamic faith) but the addition of such a room was thoughtful-and it blended in and added to the whole ambience. Very competitively priced for a passing lunch-recommended.","It was a working lunch, met a client and was lunchtime, so wanted something warming considering it was 2c outside Found this place by chance whilst driving through; had to pay for parking so was annoyed-but this is sadly London I guess!

The waitress tried to force it onto us and said we ordered mango, but one of us ca n't eat mango so we knew it was n't our mistake. This gave us a little disappointment in what brilliant service we got from the guys. Chicken wings was cooked just right, juicy, tasty, big and a very nice charcoal flavour. Liver starters, despite the liver having a rich taste to it it was yummy Lamb chops, missing that little something that we could n't out our finger on Family nan, light, fluffy great taste Curry, ok, chicken had a dry taste. Overall had a great night, would go back just for the service and starters... And to try more of the menu Thank you","Great restaurant and great service.

I opted for the chicken chasni pie which was absolutely lovely. Really tasty chicken and the chasni sauce was very good. The pie itself was lovely and hot contents and crisp crust with not a hint of soggy bottom, which is very important. The pie maintained its structure when being ate which was excellent as nothing was spilt at all and no sauce running down the hands. The carry out containers were made of card and of a substantial quality. Highly recommend this shop and look forward to my next visit.","Fist visit here today on recommendation.

1000001058,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.","Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised.
