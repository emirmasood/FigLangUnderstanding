The server did not understand the menu and gave us wrong information regarding vegetarian options multiple times. We were then given a vegetarian menu and upon ordering, we were told the menu was out of date and the options had changed / were unavailable. The afternoon tea was also below the usual standard as the sandwiches were dry / stale and the chocolate dessert was topped with canned whipped cream, followed by a whole pot of watery chocolate sauce. The other cakes were also underwhelming and it was no surprise the table next to us left their cakes uneaten. Very disappointing experience.","We visited the Ivy for a birthday celebration and were very disappointed.

Ordered lamb Haneed, One portion with rice, but if one person is eating they charge 15, if two persons are eating they charge 19 for the same quantity of food, reason, I do n't know. 3. I did n't get the free banana, other tables where Africans were eating, they gave banana, not to us. Sad. 4. I was with family, so sat in family area which was alright  but it was noisy in the restaurant. 5. Chili sauce, was very very very hot, did n't like it  but lemon soup was fantastic and soooper yummy. 6. Staff was n't understanding english much  it was tough to communicate.. but they were friendly. 7. I will still recommend for the taste.","Food was great and I recommend as it matched my pakistani taste buds but following observations. <num>. No menu card( I do n't know why) <num>.

My only gripe is that it did take a while to turn up, about an hour but they did say 45 minutes to an hour on the phone so I'm appreciative that they were honest about the wait time, only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, will be ordering again though as the curry was flavorful and the chicken was really good.","I had a Rogan Josh curry with chicken and Garlic naan bread, it was nice.

1000000832,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"Overall for a first time we would give it out of 5. Quiet midweek night out for 6 of us and pretty empty but inside is nice and inviting. The 2 staff that was on were nice friendly and happy to help with questions so 5 stars with service. Used a coupon for a free garlic bread which was pretty small so we got a small bit each but was average taste but free so ca n't complain on that. Drinks. Cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe. Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7. I would visit again but with not such a big group due to costs but we still enjoyed the evening and enjoyable just not fantastic.

My daughter was happy as there were pictures and colouring in pens and pencils to keep her amused. Decided to order at the bar instead of using the app. Drinks arrived quickly. Food also arrived promptly. I ordered the lamb Shawarma flatbread with a portion of fries. This was really tasty. However, I did feel the portion of fries was a little on the small side. No service check back was carried out. However, when my friend complained about the tartar sauce on her fish finger sandwich, they did replace it, even though she was happy just to have the sauce removed. Music was a little loud at first, but this was drowned out when it got busy.","Visited today for brunch with friends. Was n't too busy when we entered.

I always used to have their vegetarian breakfast wraps, but I had to stop ordering them because they started looking like someone had thrown the wrap around the kitchen before making it. Plus they do n't melt the cheese and because its like a slice of cheddar when you bite into it its a weird sensation, you get all the hot from the hash browns etc then you reach this cold mush. It is n't great. However, I have now found the sausage muffins, and they are beautiful. For less than 5 I can get a quorn muffin, with an unlimited hot drink and hash brown! Honestly it is such an amazing deal. I would highly recommend, especially if you like a maccys breakfast, I'd go to butlers Bell over maccys any day of the week. The staff are all so lovely. Always full of smiles. Especially this one lady, I wish I knew her name, she's blonde, so kindly spoken, she works so hard, I swear she never has a day off, every time I've been there she's been on shift.

The organisation and service was excellent and ca n't be faulted at all, fantastic staff all round. Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20). I'd recommend the place if you like this participative cabaret type of night or for a themed Christmas party.","Interesting place.

We wanted to see what specialities they had and asked for recommendations from the waitress, who was really helpful and very nice. The red onion chutney was a favourite with the poppadoms. Starters of lamb chops and chicken tikka were average, but the onion bhajis were really good. Mains were where things got really good.

It was rather old looking, much like the rest of the cinema, and very, very slow going both up and down. Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small.

During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional. From the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality, it's clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences. Whether you're craving traditional favorites or eager to explore new culinary horizons, Chikaros is sure to delight your senses and leave you coming back for more.","Chikaros, nestled in the heart of West Bromwich offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates.

Lovely servers and lovely atmosphere, however, every time I happen to go in there, the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients. All times I have been, my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them. For example, my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie. When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances. For example, I'm lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options. I ended up asking for a hot chocolate instead and giving it to my partner who complained how it tasted like it had n't been mixed at all. For the prices, there is definitely room for improvement regarding the drinks and food. I'm disappointed to say the least.","The place is lovely.

We ended up spending in excess of 100, but we did order a lot between the two of us and it was worth every penny. When we were seated, it was on a small table right next to the kitchen door, so we saw every plate that was done with go back into the kitchen. And the table had barely enough room for all of the things we ordered. The service was impeccable. We were waited on by young, professional staff who were friendly, polite and prompt( considering that it was very busy). All in all, a great night. A restaurant I'd recommend highly, and go back to in a heartbeat.","The food was amazing. I went here for a first date and it did n't dissapoint.

We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite. Although parking is a bit of an issue, particularly for those who are less able, we are looking forward to coming back again, and will likely recommend it.","First time visit today-we will be coming back.

The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers.

The staff and service was fantastic exemplary from start to finish. We had the Karage Chicken, Spicy Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki to start. The Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki were brilliant, but the Karage chicken a little disappointing. It was the crispiest chicken I have ever eaten, but it was n't very flavoursome-even with the dip. We followed this with Beef Bibimbap and Salmon Bibimbap. Both of these were brilliant-the hot beef comes in a searing hot iron bowl and continues to sizzle the whole time you eating it! The flavour was fantastic and it was nice to be able to ' self sauce ' to personal levels. We had takeaway from here before, but will definitely come back to eat in also in the future!","An amazing restaurant situated in Central MK.

The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.
Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.
The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).
It was about 1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.

Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit <num> trillion. (<num>,<num>,<num>). It was about <num> trillion in <num> when they took over. If anyone is interested, i am setting up a petition to deport the Conservative party to Rwanda, it probably won't happen, but it will give the civil service a laugh. Dear David K*****, You're not done yet! Forward the email below to your potential supporters. <num> people need to click the link and confirm their support for us to check your petition. Once you've gained the required number of supporters, we'll check your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards. If it does, we'll publish it. We have a very large number of petitions to check at the moment so it may take us longer than usual to check your petition. Thank you for your patience. Once your petition has <num> signatures it won't be able to add more until it's been checked by the petitions team.

Click this link to sign the petition: My petition: Deport the entire Conservative party to Rwanda. Send the Conservative party to Rwanda to enjoy their new life in the sun. If this isn't feasible, i would settle for just the Cabinet and Parliamentary Conservative party. They are utterly useless."

The little Audi is so easy to park, nippy down the back roads and uses a fraction of the fuel of the Discovey, but today I had a welding table to collect in the Discovey and it tows like a beast.

1000001191,sentiment,0,en-UK,Reddit,"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.","There are <num> doctors in my surgery to cover over <num> people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.

We have to MOT our cars to ensure roadworthyness, yet the roads themselves are the danger?  Especially for anything with two wheels.
Then compound the fact that motorists pay road tax, IPT on car insurance, fuel duty, VAT on fuel, council tax.  When we break the rules, we pay for speeding, bus lane violations, parking violations, etc.
How the fuck is there no money to look after the roads?  There's so many cash revenues from motorists.","Baffles my brain.

It was just a reminder because people forgot and it was causing problems. In no way was it put up because people went in with vouchers and spent it all on alcohol. 
In any case this was a covid measure and only lasted a year, so it's way old news. Meal vouchers to spend in supermarkets don't exist any more. 
This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all. 
Quite a few schools pooled the meals vouchers and bought in bulk to make up food packages, so that parents got more stuff than they would have got individually. 
Personally I think it's disgraceful that schools are practically the only safety net that kids have regarding nutrition, domestic violence and mental health.","This was because parents were doing their normal shop and then offering the vouchers at the end once everything had been scanned.
