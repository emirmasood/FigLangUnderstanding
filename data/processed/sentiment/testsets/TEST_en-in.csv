Rooms are big enough to accommodate committed people but house keeping service can be one of the best in cost range, they have their own parking for the guests but do n't have dorm for drivers, so you need to arrange a stay for your driver. They have a very good and known food stall, where you can enjoy a yummy veg meal, sweats etc. You can get room service from their restaurant. There are multiple other hotels also if you want to eat somewhere outside.","Centrum is a very good hotel and located right in place.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well. Check out Madhuram Sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy.

1000000810,sentiment,1,en-IN,Reddit,"First of all - you are incredibly brave. And definitely very strong and resilient. I shudder to even think of what you must be going through. It's truly a great failure of moral justice. 
But 
Since my belief is that as long as you are alive you have potential and as long as you have potential, you are valued, loved and cherished as a human being. If by nobody else, then at least by me. I would love to hear what happens next in your story. 
You say you are 25. You seem to be well educated. 
So just a provocation, which I would like to invite you to think about , see if it helps? 
We are conditioned to consider that the goal in life is happiness and that suffering is the lack of happiness. The world should be fair. People should be this or that. 
Where is it written? Which book? Question every core belief you grew up with and you may realise that none of it holds true 
Then the decision will become about what to sacrifice and what you may gain as a result. Again it's about taking chances and making sacrifices 
People are evil
Also 
In an evil world, do small acts of good for people who are less privileged 
Maybe our power is not in what happens to us, but the way we react to it. 
All of the above is for you to ponder over. Here is the only thing I will
Ask you to do. Read.
3 books 
A. Meditations 
B. Man's search for meaning 
C. Radical compassion 
I know it sounds like some generic platitude bullshit, but what's the harm?","First of all - you are incredibly brave. And definitely very strong and resilient.
