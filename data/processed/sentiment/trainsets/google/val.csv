Hubby is dairy intolerant and their allergen menu is accessible through a qr code. You tap in what your are allergic to and it hides menu items that are off the list. He was quite impressed with this. Unfortunately had to drop a star for food this time. I ordered buttermilk fried chicken it was huge( see pic) and had a weird curry taste. Now wondering if actually they served me the wrong thing. Two flat coated breasts arrived, I took one home for the dog and the paper towel in the box was stained yellow! Hubby fishfinger sandwich looked great but was bland.","I've really enjoyed a couple of visits on my own before. Had halloumi fries then and loved it.

No complaints whatsoever there. But after that, no one was interested in us. Seemed that most, not all, of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners. Friends ? Local celebrity ? The restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service. Decided against a dessert and figured it would be too much trouble to get a coffee so we paid and left. Wo n't go back. Shame really because the food and the restaurant itself are great.

I would suggest asking for a table away from the front door if possible. We had some really lovely food, the menu has are real range of options for every one and some great vegan options. I was really happy with the Vegan Lasagne and the dessert was the highlight. The only downside I would say is that you constantly have Uber eats / Delivery Drivers coming through the restaurant that are pushing past you at the table, alongside leaving the door open so when your seated near the front door your constantly getting cold so having to get up to close the door. It definitely ruins the atmosphere when you trying to enjoy your meal.","We came here on Thursday around <num> pm. It was fairly busy, but we thankfully booked so did n't have to wait long.

873,sentiment,0,en-AU,Google,"I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. 1. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. 2. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. 3. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes. The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions were notably small, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent. Overall, while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant, the food quality, particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes, did not meet expectations. The pricing, coupled with the small portions, further detracted from the overall dining experience. I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers.","I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. <num>. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. <num>. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. <num>. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes.

When I was served, I ordered a coffee and was bluntly told they did n't accept dirty keep cups( I had made a coffee at home when leaving). I understand it is not ideal having a dirty cup, but the way it was handled, in a rude, blunt tone was not good customer service. I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion.","Not a pleasant visit which was disappointing.

The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion."

While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n't receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station. I left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions, poor service and difficult technology. I hope Burger King can work out these kinks because I believe there is an opportunity to improve.","I had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night When I went to order at the counter, the staff told me to use the self-service kiosks instead.

6367,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant. This was the first time to Hearth after hearing good things and seeing the positive reviews. It was also a nostalgia trip, being an avid diner in Studio cafe back in the 90s when a student at the Art College in Hull in my youth. The restaurant has a simple, stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine. It also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff. We were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen. The service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks, but the main course food service was fairly slow. We decided on 2 courses and waited 45 minutes after ordering for our mains, which did seem too long. Desserts arrived much quicker, within 10 minutes The food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food( which seems to be the new bar set for Michelin guide rated food these days... as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society). Portions are generous, and Sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful. A special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion' pudding', which was deemed' the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside. The only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food, as all savoury courses and gravy did seem VERY salty. We would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating. Also, identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff, when ordering or any mention. For example, one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the( enormous) yorkshire pudding, and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free. Which was confirmed. Desserts were excellent, with interesting menu choices, and, again, generous portions. We would return, as the overall experience was enjoyable, but maybe to try the evening menu next time..","We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant.

What is different in the Poha here is it contains pieces of fried batata( potatoes). There are 2 options-normal for RS 10 and special for RS 15. Not much difference except shev is sprinkled on the Poha and a spoon is given in the special varient. Otherwise both are served on pieces of newspapers with masala sprinkled on them. Good for a normal breakfast for Poha lovers but nothing much exclusive, especially compared to the hype of the place in the city.

We had pizza which was nice but the crust was bland, it did n't have that Italian pizza crust flavour, we got fries and they were under cooked and hard in the middle so we left them and told the staff but still got charged for them.

Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance ","I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to.

As a vegetarian, I can say that the food was good, but the only one that wowed me was the pizza, which was made fresh in front of everyone. Service was excellent, and I watched them give that same service to everyone. Cash only, which was a bit weird but not too much of an annoyance in the centre of town.","Overall, it was a good experience that I'd recommend for doubles to families with kids.

The secret weapon was the mysterious and alluring Salsa Verde sauce, served on the side like a daring sidekick ready to take on any culinary challenge! Speaking of challenges, I faced the flat white quest next. It was acceptable, though it lacked a bit of magic. Still, it played well with the avocado toast, so we'll call it a breakfast truce!

The space inside the bakery is a cozy hug; think of it as breakfast in a warm embrace! However, if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats, you'll have to roll the dice with the weather. Outdoor seating is a fair-weather friend, but when it cooperates, it's a treat! Attention parents, mini-humans are welcome here!

It was not busy either but the staff were all standing and joking paying no attention to customers or bothering to clear up. The order of 2 ice creams and a frozen drink took 10 mins. Although we had paid for a large drink it was half full. It took over 5 minutes for my wife to be served despite several members of staff looking at her. The attitude was then poor. The baked that is supposed to the lost the manager and supervisor was empty. It clear there is absolutely no leadership here and no are as to whether a customer gets a decent service. When I comments to my wife 2 other customers both sitting nearby said they were also disgusted with the staff attitude etc we have photos and will be sending these to the master franchisee of McDonalds in Australia.,THE worst McDonalds we have ever been to anywhere in the world.

Their fluffy hotcakes were beautifully plated with fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, edible flowers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was topped with a generous amount of custard which made the hot cakes a tad too sweet for my liking. The malteser shake could not be finished as it was too sweet for my liking. The chilli scrambled eggs were savoury and perfectly seasoned. It is really delightful to pair those eggs with sliced avocado and slightly toasted sourdough. It was overall an enjoyable experience.

6902,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.","I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance.

Once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table. We ordered from the app; the drinks and food arrived promptly after. The pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate. It was generously topped as well and tasted good. The fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons. Overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes. The only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance( maybe they should move the smoking area)!,Update: have been a few times now and the food has n't been up scratch.

It was our first time at this particular Tim Hortons, I've never been to any Tim full stop so this was my first experience. When we arrived it was busy but not rammed, there was a queue for food' collection' which was awkwardly set up as there's not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there's a table in the way of collection also. So that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which I'm adamant does n't work in food places but they keep doing it. They could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some McDonald do but I digress. As we'd never been we used the self serve to figure out what we'd like and the menu were clear and simple, but it was so we could go and order in person as I have a blue light card. The man said Tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal / offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that. The food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer. I got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious. Thanks to the deal, for 2 meals it cost us just under 15. All in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend.

Now, I'll caveat this by saying that it seemed exceptionally busy for a Wednesday lunchtime, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked what the wait time for food would be. I did n't do this, and we ended up waiting for around 35 minutes after we'd been seated. I ordered the Badgers Beef Burger and my son the buttermilk chicken burger. Both meals come with a side of your choice. I got chunky chips, my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce. The beef burger was nice, but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry, though a mayo style dip is provided on the side. No complaints on the chicken burger from my son! The atmosphere in the bar is really nice though and the menu is extensive and well curated with a mix of traditional and contemporary meals and small plates on offer. The music playlist was right up my street, mostly well known and loved 90s and early 00s hits!","Badgers Bar & Restaurant has over <num> Google Maps reviews and a great star rating, so my son and I decided to head here for lunch during our trip to Derry / Londonderry today.

For a place like Bina, i would rate the Cold Coffee a good thing to taste there. It's a place fine for friends and not something family type. The place needs a lot of improvement atleast in terms of taste.","Its an average place overall. The sitting area is fine. The food taste can not be rated because of no consistency.

Old school, printed menus are the go","Meatball sandwich was great. Lovely fresh bread. Coffee tasted good but was highly acidic. Not a fan of the QR code menu and order setup.

We had lunch on a Monday and it was a little quiet, but this Cafe deserves a visit.","We had delicious Sweet Chilli Chicken Wraps and an Apple and Rhubarb Friande, and everything was delicious.

Well-appointed as you would expect, all of us found the different dishes on this menu to be very tasty. Definitely recommend the Saki grapefruit cocktail; It was superb.","Great streetfood style ramen dishes, which arrived at our long tables, super fast.

6164,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,If you want food to go I would say it's okay however if you're looking to eat in forget about it as you'll probably be harassed by the fake tramps asking for money. Unfortunately there always seems to be something happening at this place ie arguments. You'll experience long queues during lunch times and just after schools finish as well as it's next to a school.,If you want food to go I would say it's okay however if you're looking to eat in forget about it as you'll probably be harassed by the fake tramps asking for money.

6671,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,Nice and spacious seaside pier. Entry is free and they have various areas selling food at the front and some snacks further in. There are arcades and a small funfair if you go further in. Saw a pretty restaurant right near to the end as well. Suitable for all ages and recommended. It was a bit rainy and overcast on the day so did not see any sunset but was still lovely.,Nice and spacious seaside pier.

64,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"I considered three stars but decided on four as I like to give places a second chance if I like anything about it. The atmosphere is very cool. The service was friendly and fairly quick. I'm not a huge fan of the burritto, but that's because I do n't like onion. I went in at 2030 on a Friday and tried the chicken tenders and chips. They do n't look pretty, but they were very tender and very nice. The chips with the tenders were mostly tiny bits, like what's left over when you get to the bottom of a box.( See pic) I got a few bigger chips, one of which was frozen. I think the quality control needs some work in the kitchen. Luckily, we got large chips to share as well. These ones were very nice. I'm not sure why they were different.","I considered three stars but decided on four as I like to give places a second chance if I like anything about it. The atmosphere is very cool.

Atmosphere very good staff friendly and approachable. Bar service is good. Tables left with empty plates and dirty.

The bathrooms are clean and well maintained but, some taps do n't have water supply in them. The parking is of average size but if, you plan to watch a movie in a show which is houseful then you will have to face a huge crowd of vehicles after the end of the movie. The entrance is small.","It is nice and neat. There are high quality speakers which give you a good experience of hearing to great sound effects.

6473,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,Walked into this place for an early family dinner. The place was pretty full at the time we went in but managed to get a table. The service was very efficient. The starters were fairly good. The funghi aranchini was spot on and so was the calamari fritto. The main course were a bit of a let down. The pizza( Fiorentina) tasted like something from a supermarket. The base was not well baked and the ingredients did n't seem fresh. The dessert( Panna cotta) seemed to follow the main course-tasted like a supermarket version. Overall a disappointment,Walked into this place for an early family dinner.

After a visit to the holy temple, my stomach started gurgling, so on the way at court road, I saw this place and tasted the food. I think its worth it if you are looking for a experience away from Amritsar Paratha or Kulche, Something unique. Chicken cusinine is best and prices are upto the mark","The unique thing about this place is the amazing way they present the food. I was here just today in the afternoon and I LOVED THE FOOD.
