Initially I thought the flavour was n't as strong as what I like, but towards the end of the meal, I found it to be just right for the portion as any stronger and I probably wo n't be able to finish it. The chips are good too, crispy on the outside, soft in the middle, though it was a bit plain and not really seasoned. Overall it pretty good, would try again next time.","Got the momo burger for under <num>. I really like the meaty flavour of the patty. It savoury, slightly sweet, and flavours are really nice.

7590,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions. Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits. A hidden gem indeed, awaiting a more memorable encore. # WakefieldCafeExperience # AffordableEats","Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions.

The place has n't changed in that time, in terms of decor and food. Had plenty of tables inside, outside, upstairs, downstairs, with tables on the balconies overlooking the harbour and boardwalk. A menagerie of people frequent the place, so you'll see a diverse group of people. Inside has a rustic charm and when we walked in, the queue behind me, continued outside. In saying that, the queue dropped very quickly and our food came in a timely manner. For those that do n't like seafood, there are other options. Drink options are non-alcoholic or alcoholic depending on your preference. Suggest you grab the menu while you're in the queue and if you're with a group find a table and take menus with you, decide what you want then go order. If you want your food done a certain way, let them know, they're very accommodating and You wo n't be disappointed.","The last time I went here was when I was on holiday in <num>. 8years later I returned yesterday as a resident of Perth.

It a very good deal and the restaurant was full when we arrived so it clearly popular. There was a great atmosphere buzzing with happy diners and drinkers. Service was a bit slow but friendly and our rump steaks were a little overcooked. When we ordered, we were asked how we wanted them cooked so we asked what the chef would suggest and were told this would be medium rare which we agreed to, but they were more medium to well done. This was not a massive problem as the meat was good quality, not fatty and very tasty. We did n't complain but our waitress asked how everything was so we told her. What was really good was that the manager came straight over and offered to bring out new steaks for us but we were hungry( we waited around 50 mins already) so said we eat them but he did offer us a complimentary dessert which was very much appreciated. The cheese platter we selected was delicious and absolutely huge so more than enough for us to share. All in all, it was a lovely midweek treat that we found to be good value so we definitely come back again / recommend to friends and family.

It was also nice and warm inside despite being January and very chilly outside. Overall it's a fantastic place to come swimming with the family, it would be 5 stars although some of lockers were damaged and there are n't many family changing cubicles so you have to queue up and wait for one to become available.

Cumin forward on the flavour profile( quite dominant). Whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet-Bhuna is a dry curry and I wish it was n't served drowned in gravy. Maybe this is what other customers prefer-I like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid. The naan was a little disappointing, lacking the smoky tandoor flavour I'm used to, and there was n't a pronounced garlic flavour. Service-absolutely lovely.

My companion had waffles and a mango smoothie . the waffle( looked like store bought) and was very dry and crumbly. There was a small smear of cream and a few lines of syrup over them adorned with maybe one strawberry. The mango smoothie had NO mango taste whatsoever they did try to rectify by adding more mango but still no flavour . maybe they should taste their mango mix. Overall a bad experience at this place which is a shame because the motel is great."
764,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"It's not the best kebabs in the world but it's the best in Dalby for sure. For some reason every kebab shop here wraps their kebabs in foil before pressing them which means the actual tortilla wrap part does n't get cooked and seal shut properly so they can fall apart on you if you're not careful when eating them. However Ace uses thicker tortilla wraps so they do hold together better than other places in dalby. However I do miss the real good kebabs from other towns where they get pressed first and then put in packaging so the kebab is actually cooked and sealed shut. Still I love kebabs so I tolerate it here and as I said, Ace is the best you'll get in Dalby","It's not the best kebabs in the world but it's the best in Dalby for sure.

Loved the atmosphere it like industrial / western, lots of American style decor earthy tones and very cozy We got Brisket, cheesey kransky, chicken, Mac n chees and Big Mac Fries BRISKET: was on point. Tender, juicy with perfect bark and smoke ring. Could be me but I like a more seasoned rub. Smokey but coulda used a bit more bite, salt n pepper. At this point in my American bbq food journey I after a truly outstanding brisket to give out the 5 star rating. CHICKEN: tender and held a decent moisture. Great flavours of the rub made it through the skin and to the meat. CHEESEY KRANSKY: The winner of day. This kransky had the best snap of any kransky I ever had. Amazing flavour profile and perfectly juicy. Great bite to it. MAC N CHEESE: pretty basic flavour profile and sauce. Still looking for the perfect mac n cheese BIG MAC LOADED FRIES: lovely dry n flavoured burnt ends to cut through the fries. Sauce and lettuce added a pretty accurate flavour to the dish being homaged. Overall we were very happy with B Town BBQ experience.

From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken  tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality. And with the added incentive of a 50 % discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt, there's even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight.","The culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary.

This hotel is located just opposite to van Heusen in Kp road. Since dosa alone did nt go well, they have added few more cuisines. How ever that are n't that good either. Of course their onion uthappam and falooda were great but signature menus including dosa were not so good. Really do nt know if kothu parotta will be cooked with boiled eggs instead of raw ones. I personally liked the taste. Overall I was hoping it would be worth a 3 star but it can not exceed a 2. The ambience is good when we were dining.

6475,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over 30 of food for home delivery. It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'. Please note this is not about McDonalds overall; just this specific outlet. I do n't think we'll opt to use it again, but I doubt they care about that anyway.","By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over <num> of food for home delivery.

Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary. The back is quite pleasing on the eye. I can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer. Best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving.

Going on recommendations from over a year ago I booked. The service was good no complaints there but the food was very sub standard. The starters were ok and the crispy duck was fine. However cutting it up directly outside a toilet is a no no! This I never knew about until I got home and was told. If I had known it would have been sent back. All the mains were tasteless undercooked or overcooked unless your a sugar fanatic this place is not for you. Very disappointed indeed.

820,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"The food here is decent and so is the environment. Generally everything I had here has been good but in this review I be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day. The prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than I prefer. Personally I like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour, but that just me. The prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though. The steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked. The meat was n't as warm as I liked and the caramelised onions were n't as flavoursome as they looked to be. Overall you could n't taste much else and the sandwich( 22 I think) was only half a sandwich. Would have liked the whole thing for that price. The chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain. Tasted like there was n't any seasoning at all on them. A jug of lemon-lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better. Will have to write another review the next time I visit.","The food here is decent and so is the environment.

The food was quite dry and especially the muffin it was rock hard, I ate half and then gave it too the dog it was too hard to eat. I think the food needs to be thrown out if it sitting there too long. It also took an awkward amount of time for someone to acknowledge the fact I even walked in. I could see your busy but even a nod of the head would do. I just felt the atmosphere was loud and overstimulating, and if you do n't like that then this place is n't for you.

People are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters. We ordered from a menu in Chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food. Despite the reputation of the Sichuan region of China I must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way. One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate. Food is actually abundant, well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in. I recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent Cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon.","Went for an early dinner during the week.

With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future.

Two of us eating one will literally enjoy almost anything he's fed and neither of us really liked any of what we ordered because of the sauce. The mushrooms, prawns and fried chicken all had this sauce that had a golden syrup type flavour. It's a real shame because the mushrooms were incredible as were the prawns but they were ruined by the sauce. We were going to stay for a main, but we're nervous that sauce would be on the main as well( it was n't on the gyozas and they were absolutely lovely but again, the sauce it did come with was a little odd). Edamame was underdone. Would have given five stars except for that strange sauce. It all looked delicious too.","Grat decor, cute booths. Menu looks good.

Unfortunately sat downstairs at our last visit which does n't h gave quite the same atmosphere as a smaller room and more brightly lit although it is quieter so easier to converse. We also went for a couple of the set pieces and with a table for 4 there was very little room for the elaborate but sizeable presentation pieces and so some of the effect lost as we had to clear stand on their arrival in order to accommodate the dishes.

There is plenty of seating available( however more could be shaded) and with the edition of the public barbecues it's a location where just about everyone will enjoy. The toilets are clean and well maintained and the skatepark / bike tracks offer something for the older kids to enjoy too. It's quite evident that the council has invested considerable time and money into this location.

Mutter paneer was average but will try other punjabi dishes. Went there recently and the prices have increased but the quality of service has declined, we were sitting idle for 20mins and no one came to take order, there was hardly any waiter mostly just one. Tried the Mango shake which was great last time but pathetic this time. At first it was all sugary with less pulp we complained and send it back the waiter came with a new one but even that was nt great. So will avoid in future even for pavbhaji there are better options available.","Visited two times and the south indian dishes, veg thali and pav bhaji were great, puri plate only for 40rs and best mango Milkshake.

So I ordered it with ham( there is an option for bacon that costs extra). When it was served it looked like bacon and we worked up the courage to query it. They said that's just what the ham option looks like. I know it's shaped like sliced ham, but it tasted exactly like bacon. It was crispy and very salty, and sadly it was mostly left on my plate at the end. So if you want the bacon flavour at no extra cost, just get the ham.

My recent visit to this quaint bakery left me with an overwhelmingly positive impression, and I am eager to share my experience. The moment I stepped through the door, the aroma of freshly baked treats enveloped me, creating an immediate sense of warmth and comfort. The display cases, adorned with an array of meticulously crafted pastries, cakes, and bread, showcased the bakery commitment to both artistry and quality. The variety of options available was impressive, catering to a diverse range of tastes. From classic croissants to innovative cupcakes, each item seemed like a work of edible art. What stood out was the evident attention to detail  the perfect layers of a mille-feuille, the glossy finish on the fruit tarts, and the precision in every icing swirl. I opted for a selection of pastries and was delighted by the explosion of flavors with each bite. The freshness of the ingredients was unmistakable, and it was evident that the bakers at Bharat bakery take pride in sourcing high-quality components for their creations. In conclusion, Bharat bakery is a gem in the heart of Ranchi, offering not just baked goods but a genuine experience for the senses. Whether you're stopping by for a quick indulgence or seeking the perfect dessert for a special occasion, this bakery delivers on both taste and presentation.

But thanks to it, the food and drinks were served very quickly and the waiters took care of us well. We had scallops and sweet potato fries for appetizers and sides first, beef tacos and chicken quesadilla for the main, and the churros for dessert. Everything was so tasty and the portion was huge which I recommend sharing with friends or family. However I got food poisoning from the scallops, I felt my stomach was weird after eating at first, and then I was throwing up after approximately 3 hours of eating until the next morning. I had a high fever and my throat hurt the next few days( probably I got norovirus). my friend was completely fine so I guess my stomach is sensitive.

More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg. Do yourself a favour, go around the block and take advantage of Maccas or Hungry Jacks. At least you know what you will get there.","Wow, what an experience.

I do n't know whether this review reflects all Toby Carvery restaurants, or whether this is just applicable to Lincoln, but we wo n't be in a hurry to return to Toby Carvery, when there are so many eating establishment that offer true "" value for money ""."

Peter dealt with my need for seating for both myself and my personal assistant / essential companion quickly and easily and knew my assistant would require entry alongside me. When there everything was fairly organised although Peter must have thought otherwise as we were given a round of drinks on the house for having to wait a little bit. The view was great and the seats were comfortable. As an ambulant disabled person, I would n't hesitate to return to the Empire to see a gig and look forward to attending in the future.

It was n't the hairs and fluff in the sink, or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception, but, the hairs in the bed! At reception l apologised for complaining, but said l could n't sleep in a dirty bed.

However, l did n't even get that far, due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs, photos attached.

So, l returned to the second floor, where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air! The toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working, as the others would not flush.

The food itself was n't particularly great, especially on the first evening, although, in fairness, lunch on both days, was much better. To finish it all off, this morning a few people found their cars had been broken into, windows smashed, vehicles damaged, overnight in the car park.

894,sentiment,1,en-AU,Google,"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding.","My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him.

I would have liked it to be a bit more spicier. So if you like your spice then this is the one, they had so many options to choose from too. All in all we enjoyed the food and we will be back to try some of the other dishes and noodle boxes! The place was very clean and loads of seating. The deco was modern and not too in your face.

6463,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019. The price was also I felt too high, our bill came in at 77, which if it had been more like 50 I would have been perfectly happy.","A bit overpriced, but still tasty.

3112,sentiment,1,en-IN,Google,"A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises. I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.","A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises.

7851,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"Been here many times and this review should be 5 stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ? The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of "" scruffy "" experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.","Been here many times and this review should be <num> stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ?

True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir.

Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature.

There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian. This theatre really has scope to get improved, but has not made any improvements recently. The snacks inside this theatre is not that much great. You get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips, popcorn and egg puffs. When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience).

Located at the top of Cambridge St, it is only round the corner from another Wetherspoons, the Wather Works. Benjamin Huntsman was notable for this steel producing town as he invented crucible or cast steel & he opened a plant in Sheffield around 1740. The building is rather interesting inside with itsl industrial elements & overly large pipework. Two coffee machines on the lower floor along with an accesible toilet located to the rear. Other toilets are on the second floor up a staircase-note at the time of visiting, the ladies toilets only flushed if you press both buttons at the same time.

Contradictory to their policy, they were not checking vaccine cards. Tables were very close together, and the place was crowded. No dividers were in place. Not everyone would have a problem with all of this, but we felt a little uneasy, given the omicron outbreak. Overall i recommend.","Food was good.

Seventeen pounds for two double gins and lemonade when you can buy the bottle for the amount we had( we only had three or four of that) and it was a little painful to pay that price but it is what it is. We liked the reserved area and enjoyed all the free goodies they gave us and the staff were lovely.

The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates.

7310,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,What a great venue for a gig. We went to watch the ZUTONS here Situated in what looks like an old trading yard. It's got a funky Carribbean vibe with a great outdoor area for some fantastic street food and seating. A few indoor booths for keeping the rain off. A tidy venue for live music and I hope it keeps getting well supported to keep live music alive. Beer was priced fairly with reds stripe at 5 a pint. The staff were really friendly. The bouncers could do with some improvement they came across as arrogant and a little aggressive. If you do n't expect the Ritz and expect a funky friendly Carribbean live music and street food venue then you wo n't go wrong. Thanks for a top night.,What a great venue for a gig.

I know that some cocktails are short, but this one was REALLY short. In the picture attached, you can see the tiny glasses with the single massive ice cube each in them. Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff / service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do! But, as a hospitality worker myself, a bit too pricey to be worth it for a long stay, considering the products.

The parking is located offsite which feels very unsafe due to unhoused neighbours. Once you finally make the 5-10 minute walk back to the hotel, it is another 10 minutes to your room. When you have severe asthma this is not ideal. I wish the parking situation was a lot more clear at the point of check out. I would have reconsidered the location. In the event of an emergency( fire) the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building! The evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand. Both bed side lamps are faulty and almost zapped me when I turned the first one on. To top it all off 2 x dogs are located in the apartment below which bark every time you go out on the balcony. Not the 5 star stay I was hoping for. The room however is large and clean and the best part of the whole experience. Would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. For the price you pay and rating it has on other websites I am incredibly disappointed.","Very surprised and disappointed upon arrival compared to what you read on the internet.

My wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order, and the options become quite limited wherever we go.

There are a lot of Muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses, but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff. Would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal.

7139,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"This us a very old building with floors, staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old. On entering there is a bar on either side of the lobby that looks like a furniture shop. There was no one at the reception desk as she was chatting tk a bar man next door! Keys were given in an envelope but nothing else. We had to go back down 3 flights of stairs to find out the Wi-Fi code and also when breakfast was served. The room was very pretty but was not the one promised, we had a view of the kitchen vents / ducts which were quite noisy. Bed very comfortable, still and sparkling water and range of teas on tap. We were woken by rave music, very loud underneath our room that lasted for about 30 minutes. On telling reception she informed us that the kitchen does not have a sound system so it could not have been them. Breakfast room was a rabbit Warren away from where we were told, three members of staff, one being the initial receptionist were there. She appeared in the same dress as the day before but with tights that were ripped and laddered over both thighs. We sat and waited and then had to ask the youngest young lady if we could have some drinks, she was not confident at all and had to ask the other waitress if that was OK, no other was taken until we asked the waitress( who was busy doing most of the work) eventually we had our breakfast and it was good. Unfortunately others voting in afterwards were not so lucky and had cold tea and coffee served, no fruit salad or bowls and long waits for any attention. I would not stay again.","This us a very old building with floors, staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old.

The only issue I noticed throughout the night was that everyone in the restaurant that had ordered pizza was waiting for their meals for a while, which was really annoying because most people came with their partners, so whoever ordered pasta would get that first, and then whoever ordered pizza would get it 10mins later-which defeats the purpose of eating together at a restaurant. Meals should always be served at the same time. The drinks were really nice!

Service is incredibly slow, food arrives barely warm and glasses arrive dirty. You'd expect that for a place with stars( currently November 2023), that the food would be great too. With a menu that is heavily aimed towards their' signature' hanging kebabs, you'd at least expect them to be good. Honestly, they were the driest kebabs I've ever had, apart from the one time I tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager. Haha. The pictures really appear more juicy than they are. The chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just.. cold. Really not good enough for the price they charge. Looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails( 80 % ice) and are also waiting for too long for their meals. A table behind me of just 4 guests had to ask twice where their food was, with 10 minute intervals. Oh and the rocket was barely fresh at all.

Sad to say my egg and lettuce sandwich was rather overpriced with thick, bland bread, not much filling, no ? mayo and just blaah. Hubby salad and ham wrap was better. All up, we enjoyed our outing here, and would try it again next time in town."

This place is worth the visit just for the atmosphere, friendly service, surrounds and interesting menu.

Would have liked some chilli on it too  after all, Indonesian food with no chilli ? I had a delightful, special late lunch here, which was so atmospheric too.

I went for lunch and had a few starters plus a delicious Salt & Pepper Tofu with crispy noodles and vermicelli. The restaurant is also very clean and staff very polite. I personally do n't like places where there is loud music but I understand it's the norm mainly in these kind of restaurants specialised in cocktails. Despite that, there were few families with children and elderly people who were enjoying having their meals.","Very nice place if you want to enjoy anything from breakfast, lunch or dinner meals to just cocktails.

Was really looking forward to trying for the first time as I love schwarma, was sadly lacking unfortunately, chips were under cooked both tikka and tandoori tasted the same and were dry as sticks as was the' schwarma' which was just flavoured chicken fillets. Luckily I ordered an extra garlic sauce as none came with the kebab and the salad was basic, no cabbage. The wrap that came with the kebab was beautiful though. Pizza was OK but nothing special, plus the schwarma had an overwhelming taste of cinnamon which did not go with pizza.

Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n't see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n't think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n't risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n't quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n't hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more. There are other local Afternoon Teas that blow this out of the water.","As a Christmas gift, my wife and I went for an Afternoon Tea.

Toilets: yes, they were clean Parking: plenty of slots for a car with a trailer. A reasonable amount of parking for regular vehicles. Playground: yes. It was small, but there was enough equipment to keep most kids happy. Next to the park is a skate park, where there are older children and teens. Picnic tables: there are a few scattered around, but come early in the day if you want to snag one. Boat launch: small to medium-sized craft can get to the river here. Ramp is a bit of bitumen, stone and cement, from what I could guess. We launched a kayak from here, without damaging it.","We went to this park because of access to the Nerang River.

The Eggs Benedict and the other food all looked amazing-quality ingredients and well presented on the plate.

The beetroot latte sounded interesting. Service was friendly. Beware of the European wasps out the back which go for your food / sugary drinks and buzz around you. We moved inside and thankfully they did n't follow us. I would like to suggest they get an exterminator to find and kill the nearby nest of this aggressive, introduced species of wasp.

I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant, with a great ambient atmosphere. We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n't take long and the restaurant was ' buzzing ', it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n't order again. The gravy was far too thin / watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n't want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n't make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n't fault it.

7182,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers. Come on management, get your thinking cap on.","My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for <num> years.

Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers. Come on management, get your thinking cap on."

It's a special lively place to hang out and enjoy real entertainment at a fraction of the price you would pay in the West End to see some really famous good performance. Ambience, food, drinks etc is lovely. I wish there was a pick and mix on the menu of finger food as I as well as my friends are n't always up for eating heavy based meals. Overall lovely and there is also a comedy club. I had my husband private 40th birthday in the comedy area and it was really lovely. Few pics from Eric Benet performance on.

The fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of KFC, which is quite an accomplishment. The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it. I hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future.","I recently visited Al Baik fried chicken restaurant and overall, I had a satisfying experience.

We dined romali rotti and fried rice with peri peri alfam; it was good. However, the rice was too oily, and the drinking glasses were not cleaned properly. Even though they can accommodate more than fifty people at a time for dining, they do not have a sufficient parking area.

At first, I went in and walked back out after assuming it was shut as there was no staff around, and the whole building was empty with no music, etc. I walked around outside and spoke with a mate who said it should be open and went to try again after 20 minutes. There was a staff on the counter who looked grumpy and not welcoming, but I still ordered my burger meal. Whilst waiting, I could hear some staff at the back being loud and noisy playing about, but I just ignored it, and then they started to play music on their phones. There were no other customers until I left, but the tables were not clean. I sat on one table that was slightly clean to eat when my food was ready thinking this Jesters chunky chicken fillet meal would be great but after a few bites I knew this was a mistake, bland flavour, a few slice of shredded lettuce( nothing else) and literally a pinch of burger sauce. I would not recommend this place to anyone with how it's run.","I went in to Jesters for a quick lunch on a Saturday afternoon after a quick visit to Dewsbury. What a mistake.

Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours.

I did get a refund for the food only, but never got offered a replacement or a full refund for all the meals due to the quality of service. Observe the pictures and judge for yourself. This needs to improve in my opinion as the town is now becoming a hotspot for dining and has a buzz. Merry Christmas Wetherspoons"

Although the restaurant was packed full they were able to get us a small table for two at lunch rush, however there was a slight wait for our order. Again this was around 1 pm and the place was bustling so, to be expected. Value for money, we got 2 burgers, a mocha, and a cold drink for 60. Little bit steep for a cafe style restaurant but there are plenty of options. Nice atmosphere, located in a little alley which gets some sun, lots of greenery around and the heaters certainly kept out the cool winter chill.","Stopped here for lunch and enjoyed a big burger and coffee, the food was good, though the burger probably had a little bit too much sauce.

I only mention it because I do n't know if this was a one time occurrence or if it's common, here, but they were BUSY, not just sitting around ignoring us. Our bill was somehow lost as well. We patiently waited, understanding that they were obviously getting slammed with customers, and we mentioned nothing, and still the girl who came over to find / settle our bill insisted on taking drinks off of our bill for the wait, which was so very kind of her.

Free WiFi worked well. One of two lifts was not working, but this is n't an issue when it's quiet. Also had a small issue with the shower head not locking at a good angle, but nothing too major. Noise from the town can be heard in a quiet room, but it calms down at a reasonable hour for sleep.

Waited on by Daniel, a very friendly & helpful staff member who took our order. The Mushroom Al Forno starters were lovely and arrived hot. Our mains, Lasagne & Pollo Cacciatore were equally as hot and very flavoursome. Apart from the initial problem upon entrance the visit was very much enjoyed and we would visit again. I would recommend to park in the Houndshill carpark if driving here as it is situated right next to Bella so perfect placement. Great food and essentially hot! * Update Dec' 23. Visited again while on a Xmas break. Had the mushroom Al Forno starter again but this time it was a disappointingly smaller portion than in July when we last visited. Ordered the lasagne as Bella IS the best but when it arrived it looked horrendous. The dish had burn marks all over it and the lasagne itself was as flat as a pancake! Not acceptable and certainly not the usual quality I receive. I called the waitress over, Karolina could not apologise enough and without excuses took my burnt dish away and 10 minutes later returned, again apologised and served me with a fresh, hot, bubbling and delicious lasange. That was much appreciated. Great service. Thank you Karolina","Visited while staying in Blackpool for <num> nights and pre-booked our table a few days in advance for <num> pm.

The picture quality was really good with good brightness level. I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film.

Apparently their Chicken & Leek Frittatas are absolutely amazing, and hefty sized great looking Caesar Salad delicious also. The Frittatas and Mini( muffin sized) Quiche were each( alone, with no side salad), nice looking foccacias each. Latte & Soy Latte were both of extremely good quality, strong, tasteful cuppas. Would call again, will be trying their huge Caesar Salad next time, at only! The menu had a couple of lesser prices on it, than current prices. Specials board behind the counter. Also offering healthy, tasty and beautifully presented smoothies. Simple, FREE and easy angle parking adjacent to St Georges Square, alternatively 15 minute kerbside parking right outside the door! Convenient location, easy to stop and grab a cuppa on your way to work or wherever. Phone box across the Street. Outside dining options, lovely frontage, prime location, easily accessible to all.

Main courses were great and fairly priced-lamb cooked to perfection, enough of potato and veg( delicious dauphinois), generous portion of seabass and tasty prawns. The only disappointment was the scallops-would like to see a more elevated and sophisticated dish. On previous visit had the chowder and mackerel pate which were both delicious. The interior is quite rustic and not to our taste so do n't let it put you off as it did for us previously.","Second time visiting <num> Mussel Row and overall pleasant experience.

7003,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"Was my friends 21st birthday yesterday. His parents booked him a table at Cosmos Sheffield, invited family from Portugal and a few close friends. We were 21 in total. The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in / out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:- it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it! Thr manager was rude and definitely not helpful at all! All he wanted was us all sat eating quietly, out money and goodbye! Horrible experience!

Room was decent size, warm, clean and the bed was comfy. Shower was easy to use, and a good temperature. Enjoyed the two slides of cake available to go with a cup of tea. Only downside for the room was the radiator( or something else) that was making cloud clicking noises all night, making it really hard to sleep.

The cons: the kids' milkshake bottle was more than half with foam, the cooler drink was more ice than actual juices advertised-which after a few sips became almost tasteless, very small portion of fries for the price very little toppings, mac and cheese was no cheese sauce.

The burgers were nice, nothing bad to say about it; the chilly hot dog was very nice, I do recommend it and the girls there were lovely. The cons: the kids' milkshake bottle was more than half with foam, the cooler drink was more ice than actual juices advertised-which after a few sips became almost tasteless, very small portion of fries for the price very little toppings, mac and cheese was no cheese sauce.

Ticket is for 100rs for adults and 50rs for children below 12 yrs of age. There is a waiting area with many seats near the ticket counter where we have to wait after buying the ticket. Once there were close to 20 to 25 people, we are escorted by the guide inside who is a fort staff. We do not have to pay separately to guide. Fort is beautiful with amazing artwork. Many movies including Manikarnika has been shot here. Musuem is also good. Seperate ticket is needed to visit museum. Just outside the museum, a local painter has a shop. We bought couple of painting. He sells good paintings at a very reasonable price. Must visit place.","Intriguing and beautiful fort. Neat and clean without any pigeon or bats nuisance.

We sent it back for a replacement and amazingly the new one came out the same!! They did take it off the bill! Finally there was a small piece of wrapping plastic in my brothers dinner! We alerted them to this but the waiter basically ignored it and nothing was further said or done by them! There must be other restaurants to visit in Poole and therefore I would probably avoid. We certainly will not be going back.,Visited here <num> evenings ago with <num> others. Whilst the food generally tasted ok there were several disconcerting issues!

Sure, the seats are comfy, but it's incredibly overpriced and the screens are rather small compared to other cinemas. Often rather cold in screens and a lack of atmosphere due to hardly anyone going to the cinema. Also a lack of screens and variety in what they show. Keep an eye out, so often they will advertise a film or have posters up, and that film wo n't actually show in the cinema. Strange. Staff are nice. Popcorn is often stale and bland.

We've had afternoon teas before, but from other places at similar cost, and you usually get a small selection of bite size cakes / sweet treats each.

Wait times have massively increased, my last order I was waiting 2 hours. Food quality is also down hill. My most recent order, the pizza was very burnt and charging 4 for stuffed crust when they might have well as not put cheese in it with the amount they used. Definitely not worth 4. It upsetting that they cooked my pizza, looked at it and decided that this is the quality they want to serve. I also had plenty of cold food lately. It a shame because when they get it right the food is amazing, but they just are n't getting it right enough lately.

With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n't like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n't underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms.

The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again.

As at Burdwan town itself has 3 or 4 branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream.

Because we all know the quality of food products. All are quality products. I can review the branches of the shop. As at Burdwan town itself has <num> or <num> branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream.

The food well with that money I have spend was n't worth it for me the burger was ok the chips honestly looks from a frozen bag not even taste fresh potatoes very poor the chicken wings again looks like been cook from a day before and just been reheated if was n't for the sauce it wo n't give a taste as they was so dry and tasteless. Do I recommend well I do if you are passing by and want to watch a game ? And have a drink but to eat there no really for me and they money to spend there is no worth it

From hot dogs to chicken burgers, tandoori chicken-style pizzas and delicious French fries, Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes. The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish, the chilli paneer pizza, which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite, which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu. While the food impresses, the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch.

Walking in the front there was no visible timetable, you had to wander over to concessions and await a timed board to hit the movie you wanted to see. Worse, three times I went by in my weeks in Edinburgh, the right shutter was kept shut. One can only guess if this is mechanical failure or just lack of trying at this point. Ocean Terminal generally gives the vibe of having given up, and it feels this cinema has, too. Shame, as it used to be a really fun place to go.","Honestly, the place just looked uncared for.

The typical Thai food on the menu is great, but we wanted to experiment so oopted for the grilled squid, chicken salad and pad kra pow. All extremely delicious! Only thing I disliked was that the staff abruptly asked us to adhere to a strict 90 minute reservation, so we had to leave at sharp( we arrived at 6 pm). Wish I could stay for longer and try more food!","Really nice dining experience, long waiting lines so do n't forget to make reservations in advance.

Chips were a mixture of freshly cooked and warm ups fish was as hard as rock and totally tasteless so had obviously been sitting in the warmer for a very long time. They got the order wrong and gave us two fish, no fishcake. All in all a very disappointing meal for 30.

The menu offers a variety of gourmet pizzas, including vegetarian options. Although the selection is relatively small, I often find myself torn between choices due to the diverse array of high-quality ingredients. Occasionally, they feature a special of the day, although it not available every day. On the dessert front, the tiramisu is good, though not as standout as the pizza, and it on the smaller side. While I did n't try the coffee, I notice the young server craft a cappuccino for a colleague, and it looked quite nice. The restaurant is quite small, which adds to its charm, but may be challenging to find seating, especially during weekends.

I start with the only positive thing I can remember about this unforgettable experience( for all the wrong reasons), the decor and interior was to a high standard. The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our 27 and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them.","A friend and I visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on Instagram as well as some recommendations.

The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately <num> or <num> tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our <num> and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them."

I have not removed a beautiful lasagne topping as you would expect there simply was n't one. Nor have I mixed it up its genuinely how it arrived. It was n't sheets of lasagne, mince and beshmal sauce topped with melted cheese. It was simply mushed up pasta sheets and mince with burnt corners and hard over done bits of pasta. It was just about edible but a massive shame not particularly the most flavoursome either. It was very basic. I was expecting a lot more in terms of presentation and quality the reviews I've seen have heard fantastic things about this place but this was a massive disappointment. I never leave negative feedback and this is n't. It's simply an honest review of what I was given. It would be great to see the feedback taken on board and a genuine lasagne being introduced to their menu.","Such a shame was expecting something fantastic.

I enjoyed the carrot and red lentil soup, vegan Oxford breakfast, and fruit scone. Given that the vegan breakfast is the same price as the non vegan one and has food taken out(, eggs, sausage), I felt like it could have included more of the beans and veggies. My portion of beans was just a handful of beans. But flavor wise it was delicious. Especially the bread! Their homemade scone was also fantastic. Drink-wise I tried their teas and chai latte and did not find them great. Service is friendly but unhurried. Prepare to wait to order, and if you in a hurry, avoid lunch, especially around noon.","Lovely little nook in the basement of an old church.

4228,sentiment,1,en-IN,Google,"The Sir Mark Cubbon statue in Bangalore, set within the verdant expanse of Cubbon Park, is a historical monument dedicated to Sir Mark Cubbon, the British Commissioner of Mysore from 1834 to 1861. His tenure is often remembered for the administrative reforms and infrastructural development he brought to the region, significantly influencing the city layout and public administration system. The statue commemorates his contributions to Bangalore, serving as a bridge between the past and present. Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history. Although opinions on colonial figures are complex and varied, the presence of the Sir Mark Cubbon statue provides an opportunity for reflection on the layers of Bangalore history, offering insights into the forces that shaped the city. This monument stands not just as a piece of art, but as a historical marker that prompts discussions about legacy, governance, and the impact of colonial rule in India.","The Sir Mark Cubbon statue in Bangalore, set within the verdant expanse of Cubbon Park, is a historical monument dedicated to Sir Mark Cubbon, the British Commissioner of Mysore from <num> to <num>.

Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly. Finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid 7 for the cookie and a total of 55 for not a great product. Could have been and did expect a mich better overall experience at Neighbourhood today. I am debating about going back.... I think one more attempt is warranted.","First time at Neighbourhood today.

6211,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene! I visited with my wife the second time, we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries, which came to. We wo n't be back.","I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice.

The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex. Further to this, it our little girl enjoyed it so much that she cried when she left so it is appealing to kids.","Alright, I have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding Superbowl in Barnsley but in fairness I think some are a little harsh to say the least.

We were originally sat next to a children party, which was a bit loud. When we asked Terrell if we could move table, this was no issue for him and he fulfilled our request. Despite it being a busy evening, he always had a smile on his face and was friendly and kind. In regards to the food, everything was tasty and the portion size was fair. We waited a reasonable time for the food to come out.","We went on a busy Saturday evening as a table of <num>. Terrell was our server and went above and beyond to look after us.

We ordered the fish tacos and the pulled beef sandwich with kimchi. The fish tacos were fantastic. The Pulled beef sandwich on the other hand was very dry. Would have loved some tomatoes, cheese or even more sauce ?. One of the better places for coffee. Service was okay, got the job done efficiently.","The cafe location and atmosphere was really cool.

6689,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I was really excited about going here as it seemed very cute. We were sat at the bar where the stools mad you too tall for the bar level. We were pretty much the first ones there and my friend was reminded within five minutes of sitting that we only had the table for two hours so to order soon. Not a great start. The waiter we had on the bar was not friendly and came across condescending when explaining I was n't ordering enough( we had n't been told about the small plates before that). 14-25 per small plate and being expected to order about 5-6 between you felt a lot based on the service too. Our waiter would n't leave us alone and we got urged to order about three times before we finally did. We probably would stayed longer( we only stayed just over an hour) and had more food if it was n't for the rushed feeling. Nothing was labelled on the chalkboard as vegetarian or if there were allergies present. Even after speaking to the waiter, I was a little confused. The chef who made my meal was lovely, but he did put meat on it after the waiter had told me that one was vegetarian.","I was really excited about going here as it seemed very cute.

Red, raw and at best, pink in parts chicken, not at all stringy or cooked, literally dunked in the frier and removed and served in the time that I washed my hands. Lord is my witness, we ordered, washed my hands without using the toilet I should point out, returned and food was served. Granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse. The incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all I met with. I politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly / remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said ' just you can have refund '. Eventually they remade the food, which unsurprisingly took 3-4x longer to make and was actually cooked through. I never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain. Issues with food are understandable, but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different, and furthermore, to degrade them, and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube, not stringy white chicken, and is uncooked, followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n't know your managers name when politely asked whom I can address my concerns to given the food was shocking.","Worst customer service I encountered in years.

Ordered a chicken roll which you would usually expect to have mayo & stuffing on and perhaps cheese. We got plain chicken stuffed into a roll that was bland. Though both the roll and chicken were Cleary fresh. The chips were decent but nothing special, and quite a large portion. We got a small which was huge. The drinks fridge was poorly stocked and our preferred drinks were all out of stock forcing us to pay extra for an upgrade size which was still not our preferred drink but better then than van options. Whilst the service was good and the food fresh I do n't think we will be back again.","Nothing special at all.
