The hostess was apologetic, and we understood that our group was quite large, with other big parties in the restaurant.

2474,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.
At the moment, the ""green hydrogen"" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue. If it's genuinely useful it doesn't need subsidies.

Out of pocket healthwise you might be paying a gap at the GP (about 20-60) or at a specialist (more varied), depending on which state you are in you may want to purchase ambulance cover to avoid being charge for an ambulance ride should you need one (cover is very cheap, typically under 200p/a but a single ride is also cheap, under 2k).

Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 
Centrelink are useless. 
Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum's advocate. 
I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It's a nightmare!
Here are my pro-tips!
*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 
From memory it cost about $3500. 
They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 
*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 
You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 
Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 
I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 
I've just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let's not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 
*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 
Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it's surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 
Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 
Be your mum's advocate. That's the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It's enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 
That said, I've found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced.

1143,sentiment,1,en-AU,Reddit,"One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world's third-largest population of sheep  behind China and India  but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don't have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems' capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.
The Coalition's usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country's transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.
A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow  ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn't rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?
The battery strategy sets out a ""vision"" over the next decade, in which Australia becomes ""a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition"".
We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers' know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!
The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.
Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated  note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.
Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.
There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.
The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.
The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.
Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.
Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.","One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add.

The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as <num> per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite. Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy <num>, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill. Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making. There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity. The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $<num> million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $<num> million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $<num> million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $<num> billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies. The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money. Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry. Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition."

Americans don't dry clothes on the clothesline and will always use a dryer. 
Americans use air conditioning all the time so need to dust quite often. And then in the winter central heating will blow dust everywhere too so the dusting never stops.

There's a lot of untrue stereotypes in this thread except for a few which are for the most part true (bearing in mind that it's a population of over <num> million people and there are vast regional differences.) Americans don't dry clothes on the clothesline and will always use a dryer. Americans use air conditioning all the time so need to dust quite often. And then in the winter central heating will blow dust everywhere too so the dusting never stops. Americans tend to use more disposable plates and cups, but it tends to be lower income people who do this. But that said - I would agree that most Americans are generally less conscious of the environment. Paper towels for everything. Disposable wipes. Disposable mops like Swiffers. Disposable dusters.

1664,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Hey. Thanks for the reply. It's nice to know you can get out. Hopefully I can find something as well.
I'm not sure that there are many extra responsibilities I can take on. I've worked for my current company for over half my working life and I've worked in every department, including a stint as a supervisor that lasted for just over a year. 
I love to learn new things, and I think that's part of the reason I'm so desperate to get out, I feel like I've hit a brick wall of all that I can learn. That and the managers are kinda impossible to deal with currently. This is also combined with how shitty people are post COVID. Which is why I don't want to just get a similar job in another company. I want to get out of retail all together.
Working in the companies head office would be ideal as it's a part of the company I haven't worked in yet, but unfortunately it's located in Melbourne. 
I've got a mortgage that I share with someone and am responsible for helping take care of an elderly family member. So relocating is not possible with my current circumstances.
My brother says my issue is that I don't talk up the skills I have enough, and your reply kinda reinforced that that is something that is definitely needed.

I'm not sure that there are many extra responsibilities I can take on. I've worked for my current company for over half my working life and I've worked in every department, including a stint as a supervisor that lasted for just over a year. I love to learn new things, and I think that's part of the reason I'm so desperate to get out, I feel like I've hit a brick wall of all that I can learn. That and the managers are kinda impossible to deal with currently. This is also combined with how shitty people are post COVID. Which is why I don't want to just get a similar job in another company. I want to get out of retail all together. Working in the companies head office would be ideal as it's a part of the company I haven't worked in yet, but unfortunately it's located in Melbourne.

1708,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.

Those types of actions are beginning in the United States through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of Tony Timpa, but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding.

It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding.","My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him.

1011,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**""
Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.""","**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**"" Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.

Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.","You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain.

1390,sentiment,1,en-AU,Reddit,"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:
Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.
Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.
Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.
Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.
Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.
Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.
Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).
Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.
So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:
Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)
Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)
Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.
Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.
However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:
NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle
QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon

There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.","Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here: Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""<num> minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish. Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable. Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise. Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool. Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life. Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular. Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think). Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being <num> minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney. So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around: Perth (tour of general suburban coastline) Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety) Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than <num> minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments. Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful. However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within <num> minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state: NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay There are many others.

If you were talking about violent crimes committed against immigrants, I could understand it. That's not what you're talking about here - and frankly you're a little insulting, assuming that you are for real.
Australia's level of immigration has been far too high for several years without any commensurate expansion in infrastructure. Everyone settles in Melbourne or Sydney. This has created a very noticeable decline in living standards in terms of overcrowding - not just traffic, but in schools, hospitals, etc. A lot of people don't want any more of this and it's hard to blame them. The housing situation is unimaginably horrible and it is getting worse. The amenity of living in Australia (for those of us who knew it in the mid 90s) is now gone. 
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut about centrelink, etc. We are living in a per capita recession as we speak and mass immigration is the only way that the government can gaslight the people that everything is cool because we don't have an actual negative GDP print(even though it feels like recession for the average punter). I grew up in the US and I've been getting stick from Aussies since God was a boy. So I moved back a few months ago after many years. You can do it too, sport, if you feel strongly about it.","I was not born in Australia and I generally like to torch the cunts who were, but you protest far too much, I think.

2290,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.
Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"".
""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else.""
Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.
Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.
In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling.
""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?""
In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.
""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said.
In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.
In October 2022, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.
Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation.
Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.
Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.
""It wasn't a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister's office, and the pain of it hasn't gone away.""
""They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they're doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,"" says Dabboussy.","Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about <num> Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"". ""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else."" Most of the <num> people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials. Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus. In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling. ""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?"" In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children. ""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said. In <num>, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-<num> pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children. In October <num>, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their <num> Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney. Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, <num>, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation. Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to <num> years in prison. She is the only person among the <num> people repatriated in October <num> to face court. Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the <num> who were repatriated in October <num> have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.

2148,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program  the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.""
How this number was calculated, he didn't say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.
There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia's borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.
According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia's record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.
But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan's deputy director of migration and labour markets, ""asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it's a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.""
Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, ""it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.
""Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.""
With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton's proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.
What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.
This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.
In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.
When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.
""In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost  numbers,"" says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. ""Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.
""The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,"" says Rizvi.
The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government's shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.
In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, ""Scott Morrison told students to just go home,"" says Honeywood.
""That caused incredible damage to Australia's reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.","He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program the Coalition would free up almost <num> additional homes in the first year.

1076,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 
Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).
Edit: I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes:non-lethal snakes for a few different countries here. Australia ain't so bad.","This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.

2618,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,">I grew up thinking you needed a sink or bucket full of soapy water, then you wash from glassware to plates and finishing with the most dirty pan.
Because of how precious water is here in Australia and I grew up in drought for many years, we are basically taught not to waste water.  America on the other hand have no concept of wastage. And that can carry over to many household jobs, such as washing bath towels.  When you go to a hotel in America, they change your towels every day, a lot of places here change them once or twice a week and at the end of your stay. 
And from what I believe America is more germophobic than we are, so a lot more chemicals are used.  I would use vinegar to clean my bench down and put vinegar in our clothes wash, where as they are more likely to use bleach wipes.

2221,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 
I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is ""Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance"" and has ""consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art"" costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 
A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn't it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn't throwing away stock. 
Perhaps I'm over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don't know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 
I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don't know what I'm talking about a I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that's as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I'm definitely not a customer of yours and I don't really care what the cost of a coffee is. I'm simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that's hardly the case now.","I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge?

Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.
As part of the government's December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the ""core skills occupations list"".
Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as ""targeted for consultation"", rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.
A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was ""bizarre"" given the industry's ""mammoth task"" of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.
In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages ""would be a failure"".
""Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,"" Wawn said on Tuesday.
""Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the'maybe' list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.""
A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O'Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final ""core skills occupations list"".
""Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,"" the spokesperson said.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.
Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.
""\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,"" she said.
""There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.""
Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government's target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.
In December, O'Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but ""we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships"".
However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.","**PAYWALL:** Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.

2604,sentiment,0,en-AU,Reddit,"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.
Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry's services.
Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a ""limited-term contract"" in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads' licensing and registration arms  a deal due to expire in the 2060s.
The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was ""hoping to close any deal by the end of the year"".
A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria's bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.
A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.
""It can probably be done better,"" the minister said.
The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.
Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.
Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.
""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.""
The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.
Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.
The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.
Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.
But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.
Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.
Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.
""Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.""
Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"".
""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security  cybersecurity in particular  could quite quickly run into trouble.
""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.""
Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.
The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report.
The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.
It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.
The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.
Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.
The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.
Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.
When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.
""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time.
""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.""
The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria's coffers.
Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.
However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next 40 years.","The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.

The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer. Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered. Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership. ""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services."" The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership. Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $<num> billion by June <num>. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $<num> billion in the May <num> state budget. The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $<num> billion by June <num>. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $<num> million daily interest bill. Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below <num> per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt. But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service. Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed. Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria. ""Daniel Andrews campaigned in <num> against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying."" Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"". ""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security cybersecurity in particular could quite quickly run into trouble. ""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost."" Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $<num> in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were <num> registered births in Victoria last year, <num> marriages and <num> deaths. The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June <num> last year was $<num> million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report. The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the <num>-<num> financial year. It took the agency, on average, <num> days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the <num> months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than <num> days. The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $<num> on January. Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December <num>. The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for <num> years under a $<num> billion deal in <num> and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in <num> for more than $<num> billion. Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model. When VicRoads was partly privatised in <num>, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation. ""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time. ""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets."" The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $<num> billion into Victoria's coffers. Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs. However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next <num> years."

This place is worth the visit just for the atmosphere, friendly service, surrounds and interesting menu. I really felt comfortable with the vibe here, which bustles, yet still feels relaxed The coffee was great and I enjoyed the Nasi Goreng( a particular favourite of mine), but felt( for my tastes) that it went a little heavy on the cabbage in it. Would have liked some chilli on it too  after all, Indonesian food with no chilli ? I had a delightful, special late lunch here, which was so atmospheric too. This Cafe really needs to be experienced because it is just delightful. Even if only for coffee and cake( which is different and unexpected)  I be back for their Kimchi rice!

890,sentiment,0,en-AU,Google,"Not a pleasant visit which was disappointing. I stopped here for a break in a long journey, having been on the road 4 hours already. When I was served, I ordered a coffee and was bluntly told they did n't accept dirty keep cups( I had made a coffee at home when leaving). I understand it is not ideal having a dirty cup, but the way it was handled, in a rude, blunt tone was not good customer service. I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion.","Not a pleasant visit which was disappointing.

If you want us to have a republic, then it's your job to come up with a model people actually want, to get your MPs to present it to parliament, and then to get a majority of voters in a majority of states support it.
