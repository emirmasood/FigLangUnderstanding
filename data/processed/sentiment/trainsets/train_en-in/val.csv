Ambience is good no doubt. 1 The Turkish lamb soup was nice. 2 The hummus with chicken was also nice, tandoori roti was a little dry though but I ca n't complain. 3 Chicken Cheese Fatayer is good. 4 Chicken Ankara Tandoori was nice but had better tandoori than this. 5 Chicken Mandi rice was okay. Plus 1 Bisleri and Sprite for the above entire menu we paid which I think was little on the higher side. Did not expect this much, anyways actually the amount is high because the quantity is limited. The staff was very courteous and polite they were not properly trained but there attitude towards there guest was commendable. One table besides us ordered fish and than the couple complained that it was bland and no taste, the staff said in Turkish cuisine this is the taste but the couple did not agree. Although I feel the hotel was right they gave them a completely new chicken dish and took the fish back. So there attitude is right, the management must he having this attitude hence the employees carry it, trickle down effect.

Did not expect it to be so crowded at <num> actually so after <num> you can expect waiting. Ambience is good no doubt. <num> The Turkish lamb soup was nice. <num> The hummus with chicken was also nice, tandoori roti was a little dry though but I ca n't complain. <num> Chicken Cheese Fatayer is good. <num> Chicken Ankara Tandoori was nice but had better tandoori than this. <num> Chicken Mandi rice was okay. Plus <num> Bisleri and Sprite for the above entire menu we paid which I think was little on the higher side. Did not expect this much, anyways actually the amount is high because the quantity is limited. The staff was very courteous and polite they were not properly trained but there attitude towards there guest was commendable. One table besides us ordered fish and than the couple complained that it was bland and no taste, the staff said in Turkish cuisine this is the taste but the couple did not agree. Although I feel the hotel was right they gave them a completely new chicken dish and took the fish back. So there attitude is right, the management must he having this attitude hence the employees carry it, trickle down effect. Overall Food is good Quantity is less Ambience is nice Price is high But The attitude is just right. BTW, they have a thaal at sufficient for <num> person, did not try that but now I feel that would have been nice. Try that people for me. Take care, And Eat well."

The statue commemorates his contributions to Bangalore, serving as a bridge between the past and present. Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history. Although opinions on colonial figures are complex and varied, the presence of the Sir Mark Cubbon statue provides an opportunity for reflection on the layers of Bangalore history, offering insights into the forces that shaped the city.

5472,sentiment,1,en-IN,Reddit,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.","OP. Here is my take on this.
