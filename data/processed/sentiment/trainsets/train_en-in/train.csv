Garlic Prawns was also nice.... Big size of prawns and lil touch of garlic. Phuket fish was nice too.. subtle taste and soft fish. # Maincourse Mutton Double Gosht Biryani was outstanding, Chicken 65 and one boiled egg on top and super tender mutton pieces stuffed inside fluffy and aromatic long rice grains and those are again decorated with Barista & twig of mint. Appetizing and flavourful biryani after long time... Chicken Punjabi was amaaaazing, hot in red gravy with big chunks of tender chicken.

I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.","A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises.

So I took phone number from Google and made call but it connected to Thalassery branch. Even I made call to enquire about kannur branch they were very customer friendly and clarify my all enquiries.

Dine-in were arranged in the first floor. Staircase is very steep, i do n't prefer old people to visit here coz no seating is arranged in the ground floor. Interior were very welcoming. Table was nicely arrange to sit 4 or 5 person. We ordered Eiffel tower and Jabulani delight. Both costs _ each. Eiffel tower is the combination of cakes and Icecreams. First 3 layer is icecreams and other are cakes. At top of the tower there is a ferroro Rocher placed. Presentation of both were amazing and mesmerizing one. Jabulani delight is also a mixture of cakes and Icecreams. It's loaded with nuts and dryfruits. One thing I suggest everyone is please order this 2 item if you are of groups of four and above else you people will be trapped, because it's such a huge one comparatively.","It's a new icecream parlour in kannur.

One of my friend always say that astrology works as science predicted much later that there are 9 planets but astrologers are using them much before than that to predict horoscopes.
Also panchang can accurately predict the timing of sunrise and sunset accurately you can check that out on karwachauth and various occasions it's already written there at what time moon will come up in the sky and it exactly does.
Also, once I have been to an astrologer he didn't even look up at my horoscope what he did was just hold my hand and told every secret thing that only I knew about my life...

There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian.

When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience).

4965,sentiment,1,en-IN,Reddit,"It isn't always about a sense of pride.
It is more about the market and what make sense economically.
For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players
Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.
Why?
1 The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.
2 Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.
3 Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost

4580,sentiment,0,en-IN,Reddit,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.
Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.
According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.
The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.
On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.
Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.","Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.

Mutter paneer was average but will try other punjabi dishes. Went there recently and the prices have increased but the quality of service has declined, we were sitting idle for 20mins and no one came to take order, there was hardly any waiter mostly just one. Tried the Mango shake which was great last time but pathetic this time. At first it was all sugary with less pulp we complained and send it back the waiter came with a new one but even that was nt great. So will avoid in future even for pavbhaji there are better options available.","Visited two times and the south indian dishes, veg thali and pav bhaji were great, puri plate only for 40rs and best mango Milkshake.

The bad state of Indian traffic is completely due to bad implementation at the state level.

The fried chicken was delicious and rivaled the taste of KFC, which is quite an accomplishment. The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it. I hope they address the issue with the missing offers to provide an even better dining experience for their customers in the future.","I recently visited Al Baik fried chicken restaurant and overall, I had a satisfying experience.

Every religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati.

An ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu.

By leaving the house or fighting back, you will not solve anything. You are perhaps too young to understand a few things, and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful. Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.
I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 
We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 
The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.
The only answer is unconditional love and respect.

It was a bit irritating but we understood their issues."

When we think of Kashmir, the first thing we visualise is the beautiful Shikaras in Dal Lake, the exquisite Mughal Gardens, the cascading Shrunz and Aharbal waterfalls, the magical Betaab valley, the stunning Sonamarg and the glorious Gulmarg. True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir. Chattabal of Chitergul-Shangus area is just 32 km from district Anantnag and merely 20 km away from the famous Mughal Garden of Achabal, situated in the lap of Pir Panjal mountains. Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature. The vast green plains look like natural tapestries, as if spread by divine hands. It has two routes through which people can reach the place: one is from Shangus road, and the second is from KP Kehribal.","The valley of Kashmir has unique geographical features.

2901,sentiment,1,en-IN,Google,"The hotel is very near to shanivar wada entrance. We had Punjabi thali, it had many items and was more than sufficient for one person. It had naan raita pulao chole paneer dahi and a small lassi shot. Price is also in budget 250 RS per thali and it's value for money. The ambience is good just one problem I felt the behaviour of the waiter was a bit rude and in attitude not sure why, maybe because we were not Marathi. He was literally dropping the plates and dishes on the table as if he was doing a favour by serving the food. Also not sure why they were closing the hotel around 3-4pm, it was Sunday afternoon. Not sure why they would close it in daytime.","The hotel is very near to shanivar wada entrance. We had Punjabi thali, it had many items and was more than sufficient for one person.
