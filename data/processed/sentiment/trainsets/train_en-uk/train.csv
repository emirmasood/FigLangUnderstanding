I fully expected the room to be cleaned and tidy for booking. Why would a function room not be cleaned down and ready for the next party ?! I asked the 1 member of staff working why the room had n't been cleaned and he could n't answer why. He also did n't have a hoover to at least get rid of the food droppings. I then asked if the heating could be turned on as it was cold. I was advised the radiators did n't work. How is this acceptable when January is exceptionally cold and not have working radiators. When I had booked this venue I asked if the upstairs bar would be open, to which I was told yes, pending staffing. A few days prior I was told the bar would be open but again another issue on the day, only 1 staff member working on the downstairs bar. Later on someone else did arrive to open the upstairs bar but had to leave. I do n't expect party guests to keep going up and down the stairs to fetch drinks. A big issue for a 1st birthday party was having no baby change facilities. This should of been stated at the time of booking.

If the chain had n't been across she would have been in the room with me only partially dressed. I think this is a despicable, disrespectful way to treat guests and complained strongly at reception on my way out, receiving an apology and acknowledgement that it should n't have happened. But I'm never going back to the Liner."

Wow it was a platter indeed.. I ordered medium haddock but quite a large piece of fish arrived with lots of very nice chips, battered sausage and a pattie. I also ordered curry sauce and that was some of the best chip shop curry sauce I'd had in a long time.

Well, do n't lose it then. So we dine with a wet umbrella. The decor is stunning, the food really good, but the service, sadly lacking. Did n't appreciate our server breaking off to talk to another member of staff whilst we were ordering. Decided to go for small plates, all of which arrived in good time and were delicious. No complaints whatsoever there. But after that, no one was interested in us. Seemed that most, not all, of the servers preferred spending lengthy periods flirting with one particular trio of diners. Friends ? Local celebrity ? The restaurant was almost full so anyone not playing their part was bound to impact the quality of the service. Decided against a dessert and figured it would be too much trouble to get a coffee so we paid and left. Wo n't go back. Shame really because the food and the restaurant itself are great.

Otherwise, rooms are super and I'm impressed with the security getting to the rooms, feels safe. Kp hassle checking in, billing food back or checking out. Would stay again if there was a quieter room!"
6780,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"I went to Pulteney Bridge in Bath, and it was amazing! The bridge looks really special because it has shops built right on it, which is pretty unique. Walking across the bridge was really fun because I could stop and look at all the shops. They had everything from cute little boutiques to cozy cafes. The best part was the view of the river. It was so pretty, especially with the old buildings reflected in the water. I took lots of pictures! One thing to note is that it can get busy, especially on weekends when lots of people visit. But even with the crowds, it's still a really cool place to see. I'd definitely recommend checking out Pulteney Bridge if you're in Bath. It's a great spot for a leisurely stroll and to take in some beautiful views.","I went to Pulteney Bridge in Bath, and it was amazing!

Red, raw and at best, pink in parts chicken, not at all stringy or cooked, literally dunked in the frier and removed and served in the time that I washed my hands. Lord is my witness, we ordered, washed my hands without using the toilet I should point out, returned and food was served. Granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse. The incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all I met with. I politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly / remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said ' just you can have refund '. Eventually they remade the food, which unsurprisingly took 3-4x longer to make and was actually cooked through. I never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain. Issues with food are understandable, but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different, and furthermore, to degrade them, and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube, not stringy white chicken, and is uncooked, followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n't know your managers name when politely asked whom I can address my concerns to given the food was shocking.","Worst customer service I encountered in years.

Would highly recommend. Then I decided to go for chicken shashlik. This was very tasty, I did ask for it to be more spicy but they did n't add anything. My biggest concern was the service. I ca n't fault the people but the amount of people there was too many. We went at opening time but they literally were standing around staring and as soon as we were finished with a dish, collected it. It felt like they wanted us in and out very quickly. I would visit again but would hope for a better experience as it is nice food.","Second time visiting. A little on the pricey side in comparison to my local Indian down south.

Staff were friendly and attentive. Coffee was beautiful, and our sour dough toasties were OMG! I feel like the price was okay for what we had and the service we received. The atmosphere and regulars were lovely, including the little pup visitors. You can tell people love it here! We will definitely be back for the main menu as it looked great. My only criticisms were that the scones were very dry and almost dusty. You cut through them and end up with flour everywhere, from the inside, which was odd for me.

The atmosphere and regulars were lovely, including the little pup visitors. You can tell people love it here! We will definitely be back for the main menu as it looked great. My only criticisms were that the scones were very dry and almost dusty. You cut through them and end up with flour everywhere, from the inside, which was odd for me.

It a very good deal and the restaurant was full when we arrived so it clearly popular. There was a great atmosphere buzzing with happy diners and drinkers. Service was a bit slow but friendly and our rump steaks were a little overcooked. When we ordered, we were asked how we wanted them cooked so we asked what the chef would suggest and were told this would be medium rare which we agreed to, but they were more medium to well done. This was not a massive problem as the meat was good quality, not fatty and very tasty. We did n't complain but our waitress asked how everything was so we told her. What was really good was that the manager came straight over and offered to bring out new steaks for us but we were hungry( we waited around 50 mins already) so said we eat them but he did offer us a complimentary dessert which was very much appreciated. The cheese platter we selected was delicious and absolutely huge so more than enough for us to share. All in all, it was a lovely midweek treat that we found to be good value so we definitely come back again / recommend to friends and family.

All I see is litter and too many cars and not enough respect for each other as we push and shove back to our little castles."

The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in / out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:- it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it!

This time, we stopped for lunch and the traditional British pub food was delicious. Despite its touristy vibe, the service was welcoming, with a good beer selection. Both the Fish & Chips and the Steak and Ale Pie were excellent.

8117,sentiment,0,en-UK,Reddit,"Charge higher fees then. I hate the argument that the foreign people paying more is why our country has universities. We had universities long before they were here, and it used to work. We generated world class thinkers, scientists, workers, and inventors. I feel like there is a middle ground between only Lords and higher class going to uni like in the past, and millions of people getting stupid degrees in useless shit that we all have to pay for. 
Let's dial it back a bit towards teaching topics that require the university degree to perform. Then move out towards degrees that help with critical thinking and abstract thought, which can still help with generating ideas and new ways of working.
If money and spaces are so limited, we need to go back to using universities as a step into future work, not just a standard thing that everyone does before they get an unrelated job. That might get spending under control.","Charge higher fees then. I hate the argument that the foreign people paying more is why our country has universities.

Now, I'll caveat this by saying that it seemed exceptionally busy for a Wednesday lunchtime, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked what the wait time for food would be. I did n't do this, and we ended up waiting for around 35 minutes after we'd been seated. I ordered the Badgers Beef Burger and my son the buttermilk chicken burger. Both meals come with a side of your choice. I got chunky chips, my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce. The beef burger was nice, but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry, though a mayo style dip is provided on the side. No complaints on the chicken burger from my son! The atmosphere in the bar is really nice though and the menu is extensive and well curated with a mix of traditional and contemporary meals and small plates on offer. The music playlist was right up my street, mostly well known and loved 90s and early 00s hits!","Badgers Bar & Restaurant has over <num> Google Maps reviews and a great star rating, so my son and I decided to head here for lunch during our trip to Derry / Londonderry today.

For those not quite used to Thai spices, it can not go wrong with the salt and pepper tapas set. It includes fried calamari, amazingly flavourful chicken wings, chicken curry and rice. The Thai milk tea is also authentic. There's also a green papaya salad with the same flavour as the streets of Thailand. The service is pretty good, but the food is served very slowly, almost a 20-30 minute wait at lunchtime.

We were pretty much the first ones there and my friend was reminded within five minutes of sitting that we only had the table for two hours so to order soon. Not a great start. The waiter we had on the bar was not friendly and came across condescending when explaining I was n't ordering enough( we had n't been told about the small plates before that). 14-25 per small plate and being expected to order about 5-6 between you felt a lot based on the service too. Our waiter would n't leave us alone and we got urged to order about three times before we finally did. We probably would stayed longer( we only stayed just over an hour) and had more food if it was n't for the rushed feeling. Nothing was labelled on the chalkboard as vegetarian or if there were allergies present. Even after speaking to the waiter, I was a little confused. The chef who made my meal was lovely, but he did put meat on it after the waiter had told me that one was vegetarian.","I was really excited about going here as it seemed very cute.

With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n't like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n't underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms.

It seems people have had bad experiences with the door staff, but I disagree with what has been said about them. Admittedly I did show up pretty much as soon as they opened, so crowds were n't an issue, maybe that is the difference for others. I was thoroughly searched( which I am happy with) and even had a little chat with the door staff, telling them it was my first time visiting and he even gave a bit of a "" pep "" talk-it was lovely! I made the mistake of not brining my student ID, so I payed 11 pounds for entry, not 4, but oh well, still the price I was expecting anyways. I had a couple of drinks across the evening. They tasted good, but I'm convinced the vodka was watered down, as my drinks tasted a bit too bearable haha. Mixed feelings about the bar staff, some seemed quite fed up, but others seemed friendly. It was nice to see a range of different people from different backgrounds working in there. A good presence of security and welfare staff throughout the venue made it feel very safe, and the atmosphere was brilliant once it started to get busy.

6902,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.","I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area.

7182,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers. Come on management, get your thinking cap on.","My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for <num> years.

The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex. Further to this, it our little girl enjoyed it so much that she cried when she left so it is appealing to kids.","Alright, I have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding Superbowl in Barnsley but in fairness I think some are a little harsh to say the least.

We ordered cocktails from SB for the first time, as they were new on the menu. They were disappointing. Tasted like they were out of a can-which they were. So I do not recommend that.

We usually go for the Chef Specials, with Spinach and Cheese. This particular day at SB was incredibly busy and hardly a free table, however, we were lucky enough to sit in the banqueting area, which was a lot more comfortable. We ordered cocktails from SB for the first time, as they were new on the menu. They were disappointing. Tasted like they were out of a can-which they were. So I do not recommend that.

Despite it being in the middle of winter, we still fancied something cold and sweet. There was such a good variety of flavours, from birthday cake to pistachio to mango sorbet to their monthly special, cinnamon roll. Love that it's all clearly labelled, and that there's vegan flavours too. As I was the only person in the queue, staff really took her time with me, explaining the flavours and allowing me to taste them too. We ended going for two regular scoops(), the pistachio and oreo chocolate cheesecake which was also her favourite too. We also ordered two smaller scoops() of the birthday cake and chocolate, you ca n't go wrong with this really, can you ? Also an Americano, which we added some of the ice cream in, new twist. Great that you have the option of scoop size. There were also options for toppings too. Tasted fresh with amazing flavours, creamy and rich but not too sweet either, just right. Small seating area with a cute swing seat. Roughly seats 10-12 in total. Note, there is no toilet available. Will be returning again. Thank you","First visit here in years-still got it.

I'm happy with metric though, it's so much easier to use. 100ml of water is also 100g in weight. How simple do you need it and dealing with fractions of it?

The same eating experience could be had by visiting the ready meal section of a supermarket, heating it up at home with your own choice of music / TV. You still have to wash up. It's less fun, and cask ale tastes far better than cans or bottles. Drinks ordered on the app came super quick! Overall, it was a happy night for us. Amber Rooms is a big place, and we were lucky to get a seat. Very popular with students. Curry plus a pint on a Friday and many scrumy snack choices for under 6 why would n't it be.

8812,sentiment,0,en-UK,Reddit,"This is really about the reputation of the police. 
I'd love to be able to assume that the police wouldn't set a dog on someone without good reason.
Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.
I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge. I think it's also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers - probably most of them - would happily look the other way while that happened. I would expect this to be more likely if the guy had scorned the police officers involved, because they're extremely protective of their own hurt feelings, but that's another issue altogether.
I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.
The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it. If not, they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be, and the fact that they are usually shown to be (to all practical purposes) immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem.","This is really about the reputation of the police.

They also had these interesting displays with artifacts and information about how the Romans lived. I learned a lot about their daily routines and traditions.

The staff handled everything very well and were extremely accommodating throughout what must have been a frustrating process for them. Eventually we had 2 lanes sorted out and a thoroughly enjoyable time! Car parking is easy with a number of facilities in the area, payment for parking is best through an app we have discovered. It also free after 1600 in the carpark we chose. The bowling centre is located on the second floor of the building, there are stairs available as well as a lift should you need it. Inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks, quite a few arcade games are also available; some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes. The bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to 6 people per lane, we had 2 lanes next to each other for our group. Military discount is available making it around 8 per game, table service from the bar can be achieved by scanning a QR code from the small table at your lane. Based on this experience I would highly recommend this place for some light hearted fun.","A group of <num> of us booked this place for a leaving function, due to some people arriving late there were complications caused by our party.

On a positive note the staff were friendly and happy to help when there was an issue, and the atmosphere is nice especially when seated outside. Unfortunately the staff take it upon themselves to add their own tip to the bill, on the receipt it does state it is an optional service charge though there is no option to remove this. Tipping should be an optional choice decided by the customer, not added on sneakily by staff onto the card machine with no option to change or remove. Especially in a cashless restaurant where you have no choice but to use card, this is pretty irritating.","Not so great experience here, firstly it is cashless which is always frustrating to see in restaurants / cafes / etc. The food was ok but bacon on the pancakes was extremely overcooked and barely edible, did n't have much of a taste either.

No complaints about the chips, mushroom, peas, etc. but the sauce was cold, The steak had two extremely tough pieces of tissue running through it. These were so tough I could n't cut through them with the steak knife. These should have been trimmed out before cooking. I was left trying to cut out the edible meat from between the two lines. I think I managed to eat about half the steak. The meal was cheap, but with proper butchery could have been good. As it was, I will not return and can not recommend as this was the worse steak I have ever had.","Went on a tuesday night for a meal, it turned out this was Steak Night.

Only 1 time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft, all the other times it was warm. Even though we are only a 5 minute drive away( but do n't drive). On one occasion, I found a hair and called to complain. I was called a liar and when I asked to be put through to a manager I was told no manager was in but he'd leave a message. I never got a call back. Every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it, they put tandoori chicken on it. On their menu they have 4 different kinds of chicken, including plain. Logically, if it does n't mention what kind it is, you'd assume it means plain. We called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told "" of course! We'd never do otherwise "". Last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it! It's so strong tasting, it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza. We called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it's our fault that we did n't know that chicken means tandoori chicken. I asked if they can at least change the menu so it's obvious you're not getting plain chicken, but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid. According to the reviews on Just Eat, I am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description. This time I was apparently speaking to a shift manager, who clearly knows nothing about customer service. He was incredibly rude and spoke over me. I asked to speak to the store manager and was told they were n't in( on a Friday evening). I asked to leave a message to be called back and yes you guessed it, that call never came.

7851,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"Been here many times and this review should be 5 stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ? The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of "" scruffy "" experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.","Been here many times and this review should be <num> stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ?

On the ground floor there's a large collection of old spinning machines and loom which became even more interesting when the Room Steward began to explain their background and history, especially since he had worked assembling them years ago. There's a small costume section, some stuffed birds, an Egyptian section with a mummy and a mummified head, but the best part, in my opinion obviously, was the art gallery with the biggest collection of donated wood prints by the famous master Japanese Ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige from 19th century, including the Great Wave and Red Fuji. It's just a pity that there's no cafe serving coffee and cake or little shop selling copies of some of the paintings made into greeting cards, I would have liked to buy a few.","A surprising little gem in Blackburn Town centre nr the Town Hall. <num> floors with the art gallery upstairs.

Keys were given in an envelope but nothing else. We had to go back down 3 flights of stairs to find out the Wi-Fi code and also when breakfast was served. The room was very pretty but was not the one promised, we had a view of the kitchen vents / ducts which were quite noisy. Bed very comfortable, still and sparkling water and range of teas on tap. We were woken by rave music, very loud underneath our room that lasted for about 30 minutes. On telling reception she informed us that the kitchen does not have a sound system so it could not have been them. Breakfast room was a rabbit Warren away from where we were told, three members of staff, one being the initial receptionist were there. She appeared in the same dress as the day before but with tights that were ripped and laddered over both thighs. We sat and waited and then had to ask the youngest young lady if we could have some drinks, she was not confident at all and had to ask the other waitress if that was OK, no other was taken until we asked the waitress( who was busy doing most of the work) eventually we had our breakfast and it was good. Unfortunately others voting in afterwards were not so lucky and had cold tea and coffee served, no fruit salad or bowls and long waits for any attention.

7663,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,We had a family birthday meal at this restaurant on Wednesday delayed by a year as this time last year the establishment was closed for decoration. Going on recommendations from over a year ago I booked. The service was good no complaints there but the food was very sub standard. The starters were ok and the crispy duck was fine. However cutting it up directly outside a toilet is a no no! This I never knew about until I got home and was told. If I had known it would have been sent back. All the mains were tasteless undercooked or overcooked unless your a sugar fanatic this place is not for you. Very disappointed indeed.

To be fair, I think for this night they may have been a bit understaffed. There was a large party in the back and we did n't see our waitress much after our food came. I think the poor thing was running around helping in the back. I only mention it because I do n't know if this was a one time occurrence or if it's common, here, but they were BUSY, not just sitting around ignoring us. Our bill was somehow lost as well. We patiently waited, understanding that they were obviously getting slammed with customers, and we mentioned nothing, and still the girl who came over to find / settle our bill insisted on taking drinks off of our bill for the wait, which was so very kind of her. Great meal on a busy night, we were pleased with everything. We would definitely go back, the food was amazing. I'd love to try a few more dishes!"

The sofa and chairs was n't very nice to eat on at all. The sausages were not nice, coffee was OK just half a cup. The bacon was nice, egg was snotty, i had to ask for sauce, black pudding was OK.

Arrived on time to be told our table had been taken as a party of 6 had turned up earlier so would be available' soon'. Stood waiting for about 10 minutes then table became available. Waited on by Daniel, a very friendly & helpful staff member who took our order. The Mushroom Al Forno starters were lovely and arrived hot. Our mains, Lasagne & Pollo Cacciatore were equally as hot and very flavoursome. Apart from the initial problem upon entrance the visit was very much enjoyed and we would visit again. I would recommend to park in the Houndshill carpark if driving here as it is situated right next to Bella so perfect placement. Great food and essentially hot! * Update Dec' 23. Visited again while on a Xmas break. Had the mushroom Al Forno starter again but this time it was a disappointingly smaller portion than in July when we last visited. Ordered the lasagne as Bella IS the best but when it arrived it looked horrendous. The dish had burn marks all over it and the lasagne itself was as flat as a pancake! Not acceptable and certainly not the usual quality I receive. I called the waitress over, Karolina could not apologise enough and without excuses took my burnt dish away and 10 minutes later returned, again apologised and served me with a fresh, hot, bubbling and delicious lasange. That was much appreciated. Great service. Thank you Karolina","Visited while staying in Blackpool for <num> nights and pre-booked our table a few days in advance for <num> pm.

It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'. Please note this is not about McDonalds overall; just this specific outlet. I do n't think we'll opt to use it again, but I doubt they care about that anyway.","By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over <num> of food for home delivery.

There are also a few parking spaces available around the outside of the building and disabled access."

The service is, one of the waiter is very nice to us, he serviced us instantly and bring whatever we want. However, while we sat for our booked table with just 3 min, we are asked to switch table and gave the table to a group of people who do n't have reservations. The pastas are amazing. I love them so much, one is creamy and rich, another one is fresh and delicious. However, the salad and pizza is slightly disappointed. It was n't bad at all but it just nothing special especially comparing to the pasta. The price is very decent. Four of us for 4 dishes only cost each of us 17 pounds per person. Anyway I highly recommended to visit it for pasta!!!","Excellent experience at Da Mario! When I first walk into the restaurant, I can smell the flavour of Italian from the surroundings.

My wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order, and the options become quite limited wherever we go. The chef was very thorough and came to the table to discuss the options. We ended up getting the vegetable biryani. For myself, I had the crispy fried vegetable momos( not gluten free by the way). They were spicy and delicious. Came with a sour cream sauce and a kind of sweet chilly sauce. One thing I would highly suggest is to have halal chicken options. There are a lot of Muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses, but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff. Would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal. Overall very reasonably priced and tasty, could do with more halal and gluten free options.","Great value for money, tasty food and amazing customer experience.

From the moment I walked in, the energetic and lively atmosphere immediately set the tone for a fun dining experience. The staff at TGI Fridays were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit. Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours. However, the staff did their best to manage the crowd efficiently and keep waiting times to a minimum. Nevertheless, it's advisable to book a table in advance to avoid any potential delays. Despite the wait, TGI Fridays in Telford consistently delivers a reliable dining experience. The food is consistently flavorful, the service is attentive, and the environment is vibrant. Whether you are looking for a casual meal or a place to celebrate with friends, TGI Fridays is a great choice. I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you're in the area and craving some delicious American fare!","This TGI Fridays in Telford provided a consistently enjoyable dining experience.

The kids played on the Nintendo Wii but there was no vr to be seen. Maybe it's hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it. The kids fired up the Xbox but it only had 1 controller so they could n't play together which was a shame. A huge selection of board games were available which was ace too.

6463,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019. The price was also I felt too high, our bill came in at 77, which if it had been more like 50 I would have been perfectly happy.","A bit overpriced, but still tasty.

People are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters. We ordered from a menu in Chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food. Despite the reputation of the Sichuan region of China I must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way. One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate. Food is actually abundant, well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in. I recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent Cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon.","Went for an early dinner during the week.

Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n't see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n't think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n't risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n't quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n't hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more. There are other local Afternoon Teas that blow this out of the water.","As a Christmas gift, my wife and I went for an Afternoon Tea.

As you walk in you're welcomed with a warm cozy vibe and a lovely snack and wine bar. The colours throughout were vibrant and very sophisticate. The staff were friendly and approachable which is always a bonus. The cinema was very clean and spacious, which makes a huge difference. The menue options were good also, we selected a variety of things, popcorn, ice cream, burgers etc We opted for a sofa seat which was perfect for the evening as there was plenty of leg room.

Occasionally, they feature a special of the day, although it not available every day. On the dessert front, the tiramisu is good, though not as standout as the pizza, and it on the smaller side.

It has multiple floors, plenty of space for small and larger grous alike. It has plenty of character and plenty on the walls if you like the wetherspoons facts / area histories. Food was served pretty quickly, although it was quite empty when i ordered. It did get quite packed after, so i go lucky with timing. Staff were all friendly and checked my meal was all good, and that it was. Nothing missing from my order, and the same great prices wetherspoons are known for. Would recommend, especially if you need somewhere to burn some time before catching a train.","Lovely wetherspoons. Ca n't really tell its true size till you're inside, but it is very spacious.

Was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at Wingstop sounded very tasty on the board. I ordered the box of 8 boneless chicken, fries with the Wingstop flavoring and a drink. What was served up however, was mediocre, the chicken was just warm and did n't contain much sauce on them. In the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring-mine arrived with a dash of flavour. I do have to say the Brazilian and Mango Habanero sauces were good though. The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again. If I ever did venture in again, perhaps I'd try a burger.","Ridiculously overpriced food-you can get better at KFC for less.

Their sushi choices, although limited, are very good as well, with the best value for money you can ever find around Greater Manchester. All their food items are nice, but the portions are slightly small, and have actually decreased in volume, throughout the course of the past two years( since it moved to its current location). Still, with the good prices, it has great value for money, and is seen as a bargain, with some rather authentic Asian dishes.","Their' lunchbox' choices and'' fried noodles are the best bargain you can find anywhere around Sale.

I know that some cocktails are short, but this one was REALLY short. In the picture attached, you can see the tiny glasses with the single massive ice cube each in them. Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff / service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do! But, as a hospitality worker myself, a bit too pricey to be worth it for a long stay, considering the products.

We're had Tories so long that what classifies as left is so skewed.
Also, in these times we need a lot more'left' policies. Controlling housing, making taking over private services like trains, supporting the people, taxing profiteering from corporations.
These kinds of things have gone out of control lately and need to be reigned in, so I'm that sense I think most people support this kind of stuff.

6211,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene! I visited with my wife the second time, we had a bacon cheeseburger each and shared a small fries, which came to. We wo n't be back.","I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice.

Our overall experience was quite pleasant. The staff at the pub were friendly and welcoming, which added to the positive atmosphere of the place. One of the highlights of our visit was the wide variety of beverages available. They had an impressive selection of drinks, from local ales to cocktails and non-alcoholic options. It catered to different tastes, making it a great spot for a group with diverse preferences. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5-star rating is that while the drinks and service were excellent, the food menu was a bit limited, and some of the dishes we ordered were just average.

If you did manage to go in during service times to see the church you are more than likely not going to be welcomed as a small group of the congregation are standoffish and aggressive. However most of the congregation nearer the front of the church are lovely as are the alter servers.,Church is locked outside of service hours.

6630,sentiment,1,en-UK,Google,"I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread, featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri-salted chips and chili cheese bites. The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates. I enthusiastically recommend Amigos to gourmet burger enthusiasts seeking an unforgettable indulgence.","I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread, featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri-salted chips and chili cheese bites.

The cocktails are of exceptional quality, albeit somewhat pricey. The atmosphere inside is warm and inviting, reminiscent of a bustling metropolis rather than a quaint town. The service for drink orders at the bar was slightly tardy, but this is understandable considering the high volume of customers on a Saturday evening. Overall, it is a delightful local establishment.","A sophisticated cocktail bar that also serves as an Indian restaurant( I have not yet had the opportunity to sample the cuisine).

Plenty of spaces if you like spacious fine dining. I opted to sit near the escape doors at the back of the venue as the last time I was in the same venue it got pretty ugly, and although this time my visit was during the day, I opted for safety over risk. Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary. The back is quite pleasing on the eye. I can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer. Best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving. Interesting experience nonetheless.","Popped into this place for a meal( lunch). Found the app too annoying to use so I ordered the old school way( at the bar).

8492,sentiment,0,en-UK,Reddit,"It's because it includes payments from private pensions too. Pensions are basically treated as normal income taxable income.
Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.
The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.
We really don't need policies giving loads of cash to wealthy old people who don't contribute to productivity.","It's because it includes payments from private pensions too.

They are well priced though, and perhaps this kind of thing is what the regulars prefer.","Excellent beer pub with a good atmosphere, but both the burger and pizza I've had here were disappointing, plentiful but lacking quality, pretty retro for a modern pub.

It took about 10 mins to make the food, all cooked in front of you. The food was really nice, the king pao was n't as spicy as a naga( as he said) but to most people it will be very spicy. I would have liked it to be a bit more spicier. So if you like your spice then this is the one, they had so many options to choose from too. All in all we enjoyed the food and we will be back to try some of the other dishes and noodle boxes! The place was very clean and loads of seating. The deco was modern and not too in your face.

There's on street disc parking nearby, and with its close proximity to the city centre, there are ample car parks to choose from. There are good public transport links to the city as well. Dogs are allowed. Helpful and friendly staff who were very efficient. A good choice of hot and cold beverages, to sit in or take away. The cups are fabulous. They all have something descriptive written on the bottom. What will yours say ? A wide choice of breakfasts, including vegetarian and vegan. Light meals and sweet treats are available, too. The cafe is split across two levels. The upper level is accessed by stairs. This is where the compact toilet facilities are located. I want to go again to sample more of the menu. Today, I went with the Little Foxes breakfast, Earl Grey tea, and a chocolate Brownie.","Card only payment. It was my first visit here.
