I ordered from here for years but the last times it been pretty awful, smoked shredded chicken although I always order from the starter menu the chicken is always different, sometimes in a sweet sauce sometimes not, sometimes just plain chicken, recently it been very dry and tasteless & you always get a different amount, quite often half filled. The chips are always dirty looking like they been cooked in used oil and are always dry and tasteless. The rice is quite often stuck together and a lot of it is brown like it been over cooked.

Service is incredibly slow, food arrives barely warm and glasses arrive dirty. You'd expect that for a place with stars( currently November 2023), that the food would be great too. With a menu that is heavily aimed towards their' signature' hanging kebabs, you'd at least expect them to be good. Honestly, they were the driest kebabs I've ever had, apart from the one time I tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager. Haha. The pictures really appear more juicy than they are. The chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just.. cold. Really not good enough for the price they charge. Looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails( 80 % ice) and are also waiting for too long for their meals. A table behind me of just 4 guests had to ask twice where their food was, with 10 minute intervals. Oh and the rocket was barely fresh at all.

Pizza was OK but nothing special, plus the schwarma had an overwhelming taste of cinnamon which did not go with pizza. Really disappointed wo n't be going back."

I start with the only positive thing I can remember about this unforgettable experience( for all the wrong reasons), the decor and interior was to a high standard. The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly. We begrudgingly paid our 27 and left to find another place to eat. The Google reviews and other social media posts have positive things to say but unfortunately on my visit and with what I had I can not agree with them.","A friend and I visited after seeing their reviews and pictures on Instagram as well as some recommendations.

Brewdog has a large selection of beers-the staple Brewdog beers, and some exciting guest beers and ciders to accompany them. There are also some more ' exotic( expensive) ' cans in the fridges next to the bar, which are always interesting to try. I usually grab a few to share. The food is great-the Buffalo Chicken Burger is a big favourite and the service is usually brilliant. This time, however, one main from our order was completely forgotten and then when reminded( 10 minutes after the other 2 dishes had come out), the wrong burger was delivered and so everyone else had finished and needed to leave before I got my food! At the point of ordering there was also a few things not available, but with no signage / notes to let people know. The table gives you a QR code to order food / drink from, however after selecting everything and attempting to check out, it flags an error. This happened for all 3 of us. In spite of all of this, it still a good place to go, and the above is not the usual standard of service.","A great bar, with great food in the hub, Milton Keynes.

Also I was at Oxford at the same time as Johnson, Mogg, Cameron etc. Johnson was a celebrity there, everyone had heard of him. Not particularly unusual because public school kids all know each other before they get to Oxford. But I wasn't even in a University college and knew about him.
Do a google search for Johnson and the Bullingdon club to find out some of the stuff they got up to.

I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant, with a great ambient atmosphere. We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n't take long and the restaurant was ' buzzing ', it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n't order again. The gravy was far too thin / watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n't want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n't make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n't fault it. Beautiful Menu, great atmosphere, very good staff and definitely worth it.","I had this place on my list for a while now.

There is a small bar and vending machine but we did n't purchase anything from either. We came into the hotel via the lift from the car park. Car park cost paid at reception is 15 for when you arrive till midnight the following day. Checkout is at 12 noon so we put our luggage in the car and went out for lunch and shopping before heading home To get to the hotel by car you will most likely have to come through the clean air zone, I was driving a hybrid so there was no charge. Though I had to check online to be sure as I'm not well versed in the zone charges and rules etc. The location of the hotel is really good, about a 5-10 minute walk to shops / restaurants.

I don't know whether they're just ideologically-motivated, taking orders from the government which contradict their intended purpose, or taking monetary bribes. All I know is that they're acting as a ferry service for illegal immigrants when they should be keeping them out. That's corruption no matter how you slice it.","I wouldn't be surprised.

The wine glasses for red wine were not appropriate in my opinion, much too small. The food was pretty good, decent portion sizes and good value. The sauces accompanying them complimented the food well. So why 2 * ? There is an amount of trust you need to have between a customer and a business, and when applying an already large %( discretionary) service charge, it should be correct. Charging over 9 on a 59 bill is not right at all, and it should not be the responsibility of the customer to notice this. I was told that previous complaints have been made on this, and it is a shame it has not been fixed already.","The restaurant is very well decorated inside, and has a decent atmosphere even on a Tuesday night.

It was also a nostalgia trip, being an avid diner in Studio cafe back in the 90s when a student at the Art College in Hull in my youth. The restaurant has a simple, stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine. It also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff. We were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen. The service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks, but the main course food service was fairly slow. We decided on 2 courses and waited 45 minutes after ordering for our mains, which did seem too long. Desserts arrived much quicker, within 10 minutes The food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food( which seems to be the new bar set for Michelin guide rated food these days... as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society). Portions are generous, and Sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful. A special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion' pudding', which was deemed' the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside. The only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food, as all savoury courses and gravy did seem VERY salty. We would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating. Also, identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff, when ordering or any mention. For example, one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the( enormous) yorkshire pudding, and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free. Which was confirmed. Desserts were excellent, with interesting menu choices, and, again, generous portions. We would return, as the overall experience was enjoyable, but maybe to try the evening menu next time..","We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant.

As a vegetarian, I can say that the food was good, but the only one that wowed me was the pizza, which was made fresh in front of everyone. Service was excellent, and I watched them give that same service to everyone. Cash only, which was a bit weird but not too much of an annoyance in the centre of town.","Overall, it was a good experience that I'd recommend for doubles to families with kids.

No one expects the broker to work for free. But you don't need a PhD in behavioural economics to understand that, if a service is chosen by a party which not only doesn't pay the bill, but gets a cut, then the result will be inflated prices.
The problem here is not that the broker gets a commission - it is that insurance commissions are shared between brokers and managing agents/freeholders. But the bill is paid by the leaseholders.
This creates an incentive to choose the more expensive policy, if it pays a higher commission.

I had the breakfast board-great variety and delicious Bircher. My hash brown was sadly a bit soggy, but as always I leave no potato behind. Avocado toast was fine, not my personal preference for toast but it was a solid breakfast overall. They have oat and soya milk for coffee. Service is order-at-the-counter and very efficient!","Nice place with a good variety of breakfast options. Enjoyed the atmosphere( it was crowded but not crazy) and it seemed very popular.

The only reason I feel like is not appropriate is the price compared to portion size really. Everything else is honestly top quality, with pop ups, plants, and little gifts and goodies for sale too. We have been here twice and no doubt will return. I do recommend for brunch, if you after a light bite while you work!","Immaculate vibes, immaculate interior, and the menu is great too.

I don't understand why in today's society they get off so easily, just 20 years ago I would ride my bike to the shops and leave it outside (no lock) and when I returned it'd still be there. Nowadays, thieves roam around with angle grinders knowing full well, no one is going to stop them and there will be almost no consequence if they get caught.","Thieves need harsher convictions.

Like if chicken is n't cook with extra hot oil in order for it to absorb less oil. Service is excellent, everyone is very polite and they try to keep the area clean. Not all customers bin their food leftovers just like in other fast food places, which is a total shame. Anyway, I would totally recommend those fries","We were in this branch for lunch on 24th The fries are delicious however the burger was too oily that my partner and I felt like the meal was too heavy.

Awesome food, great service and great atmosphere. Plenty of great steaks to choose from and great menu. Bars dotted around on all levels and a great place to chill out and perhaps have a little dabble as well. Although, that's not my thing, but I do like watching, especially the highs and lows...","Every time I'm in central London around Leicester Square, then this is a place I have to visit for a steak at their restaurant.

7346,sentiment,0,en-UK,Google,"What a shame, we were so looking forward to this place but it just did n't live up to expectations at all. It's a nice venue, and service is pretty good albeit a little clinical. We ordered some burgers and sides, the buffalo strips being really good( although they did taste like deep fried chicken soaked in Frank Hot Sauce) and the loaded fries were also good. The issue however was with the burgers... and it's not they really TASTED of it, but they smelt like a cow shed! I get it, it's beef but I want to taste and smell BEEF not COW. It was a mix of meat and... well, cow s * * * as my darling wife put it. It just completely put us off, whether it was a bad batch, or it's meant to be like that I'm not sure but was completely not for us. We left half of our food( see the pic), and no one questioned anything, did n't even ask if everything was okay-just cleared up and brought the bill. We booked for 7 pm-by we were walking out the door having been served, disappointed and paid! Compared to the Beefy Boys, you have a long long way to go, but we really did want to try( and like) somewhere else-it's just not this place, at all. Sorry","What a shame, we were so looking forward to this place but it just did n't live up to expectations at all. It's a nice venue, and service is pretty good albeit a little clinical.

Fuck off. You can't relentlessly insult, degrade, humiliate, accuse, blame and discriminate against people and then expect them to literally die to protect you.

Service is friendly and the food is hot and plentiful. The breakfast menu options should please everyone and you do n't have to wait too long to kill those morning hunger pangs.
