1000001683,sarcasm,0,en-UK,Reddit,"The last Gov report showed the cost to the UK of reoffending was around 18 billion a year. 
The same statistics put the cost of housing a prisoner each year somewhere around 50k.
In the UK currently we have 95k people in prison.
Let's say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.
People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can't. It's not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.

My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper.
