1000001225,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.
At the moment, the ""green hydrogen"" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue. If it's genuinely useful it doesn't need subsidies.

1000001269,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.

1000001308,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. ""If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.""","The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.

Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).
Edit: I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes:non-lethal snakes for a few different countries here. Australia ain't so bad.","This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.

He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep.
