Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.
As part of the government's December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the ""core skills occupations list"".
Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as ""targeted for consultation"", rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.
A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was ""bizarre"" given the industry's ""mammoth task"" of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.
In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages ""would be a failure"".
""Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,"" Wawn said on Tuesday.
""Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the'maybe' list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.""
A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O'Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final ""core skills occupations list"".
""Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,"" the spokesperson said.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.
Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.
""\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,"" she said.
""There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.""
Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government's target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.
In December, O'Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but ""we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships"".
However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.","**PAYWALL:** Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.
My advice is that don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.
It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.
Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me.

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.

""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""

- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.

Government has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. 
They could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such. Who will be the customers? The same people who paid taxes for building the highways in the first place. 
People are asking for free health care and education... Will that not create losses?

Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

11789,sarcasm,0,en-IN,Reddit,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.","OP. Here is my take on this.

The problem is created by government policy and can only be solved through changing laws. 
We are governed by political interests that undermine economic interests. 
It's like asking the children to run the kindergarten. 
All of these essential services and healthcare, aged, doctors, teachers, are all ultimately being paid for by taxpayers. 
Increasing their salaries only increases our inability to afford it. 
There is no doubt that we need to raise the minimum wage to meet the demands of the cost of living. 
$30 per hour is not unreasonable.
However you would currently after a 38 hour week receive 
$930 a week. 
At $29 per hour you would be getting $905 . 
If we just paid a basic minimum wage of $550 per week and a flat tax rate of 47 percent then we could actually pay people to look after our elderly at $20 per hour. 
Far more affordable. 
They would be receiving $907 a week nett. 
Someone receiving $30 per hour would be on $1154 per week nett, hundreds more. But only $15 a week nett to the government in cost. 
People can then work 5 hours or 50 , we don't spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset's and everything little things they earn. 
You cut off hundreds of thousands of pages of red tape. 
Government departments should be running as they are all part of the same organisation, but they don't. 
They have no idea how to cooperate with each other and work together towards a common cause.

The problem is created by government policy and can only be solved through changing laws. We are governed by political interests that undermine economic interests. It's like asking the children to run the kindergarten. All of these essential services and healthcare, aged, doctors, teachers, are all ultimately being paid for by taxpayers. Increasing their salaries only increases our inability to afford it. There is no doubt that we need to raise the minimum wage to meet the demands of the cost of living. $<num> per hour is not unreasonable. However you would currently after a <num> hour week receive $<num> a week. At $<num> per hour you would be getting $<num> . If we just paid a basic minimum wage of $<num> per week and a flat tax rate of <num> percent then we could actually pay people to look after our elderly at $<num> per hour. Far more affordable. They would be receiving $<num> a week nett. Someone receiving $<num> per hour would be on $<num> per week nett, hundreds more. But only $<num> a week nett to the government in cost. People can then work <num> hours or <num> , we don't spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset's and everything little things they earn. You cut off hundreds of thousands of pages of red tape. Government departments should be running as they are all part of the same organisation, but they don't. They have no idea how to cooperate with each other and work together towards a common cause. All fighting for their own patch of money and funding.

10019,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"As much as I agree with Samaras, I think ultimately that Perrett saying that *""grand narratives belonged in election campaigns rather than budgets""* is probably the more practical truth.
This puts Labor in a position they're very comfortable in - lip service about the change they want, but only carrying out the changes they need (or believe they can afford) to make.
This is a fundamental issue with democracy under neoliberal and capitalist assumptions. It keeps the leftwing establishment from the proper work of nation building, keeps them ""tinkering around the edges"" as the article puts it - and allows for a ratcheting to the right of politics.
It's easy to cut taxes on wealth and big business donors. It's easy to take some money from here, put it there, to let Capitalism usurp your party's values over time. Much easier than standing up for your country, your values, or people who actually vote you in/out.
You need an economic radical to actually make substantial changes, someone willing to test things like Modern Monetary Theory, or to challenge mining giants. The exact kind of people who would never be allowed to make it that far in politics.","As much as I agree with Samaras, I think ultimately that Perrett saying that *""grand narratives belonged in election campaigns rather than budgets""* is probably the more practical truth.

10281,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.
Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.
Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.
The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.
The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.
It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.
The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.
Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it? The ends don't justify the means.","Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake?

9423,sarcasm,1,en-AU,Reddit,"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**""
Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.""","**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**"" Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.

University is a class gateway It used to be a stamp of approval that said ""yep, this guy's posh, he's one of the old boys, give him a job"" Then people saw that university graduates had better outcomes and thought it was something about university itself.

-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots
-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.
-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 
- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 
-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 
I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 
My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don't use it to date, it's frowned upon but once you get out there you'll meet people anyway. 
There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 
I am an introvert so it's perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 
I am not single luckily, I wouldn't want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people.

I'd love to be able to assume that the police wouldn't set a dog on someone without good reason.
Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.
I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge. I think it's also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers - probably most of them - would happily look the other way while that happened.

I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.
The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it. If not, they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be, and the fact that they are usually shown to be (to all practical purposes) immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem.","This is really about the reputation of the police.

9739,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program  the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.""
How this number was calculated, he didn't say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.
There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia's borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.
According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia's record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.
But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan's deputy director of migration and labour markets, ""asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it's a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.""
Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, ""it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.
""Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.""
With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton's proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.
What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.
This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.
In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.
When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.
""In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost  numbers,"" says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. ""Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.
""The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,"" says Rizvi.
The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government's shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.
In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, ""Scott Morrison told students to just go home,"" says Honeywood.

By many accounts, MMA went to war with those who did not support the transformation initiative.
In a September 2023 submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the integrity of consulting services, Meals on Wheels Victoria state manager Alina Tooley said the mission to bring services together in a ""unified"" national network was being undercut by MMA.
""Rather than stabilising and modernising the network, MMA are creating more work for an already overworked sector, and causing confusion, disharmony and angst,"" the submission says. ""The national meals network is now less stable than prior to the commencement of Future Fit.""
In its own final report, MMA singled out Meals on Wheels Victoria for its ""multi-year campaign  to prosecute the problem, raise community fears and failure to offer a solution"".
As local councils increasingly look to get out of running Meals on Wheels services themselves, enormous gaps have emerged in a crucial but poorly funded segment of the aged-care sector.
In March last year, Aged Care Minister Anika Wells announced a $2.2 million pilot program through Meals on Wheels Newcastle and the Queensland body to take over the services vacated by Whitehorse and Ballarat local councils in Victoria. The funding was made through Future Fit, she announced.
Meals on Wheels Victoria was not approached to run the service.
Correspondence between Gunaratnam and health department secretary Russell Herald, who is the departmental signatory on the MMA contracts, confirms the consulting firm was deeply involved in the Whitehorse transition from July last year, right down to the details of the menu cycle, although MMA is not an accredited provider of home support services.
""How are we going with PDF's of the fortnightly menus?"" Herald asked MMA in October. ""Any chance by tomorrow.""
Herald, in his capacity as the contract owner and with aged-care policy responsibility for home support, has worked closely with MMA. In turn the consultancy has worked with an existing aged-care company, Polixen, which has long offered a desktop customer resource management (CRM) tool designed specifically for Meals on Wheels providers.
The vast majority of Meals on Wheels services in MMA's own surveys said they used Polixen software to manage clients' resources, delivery routes and rosters.
In the second official work order signed by Gunaratnam and Herald, MMA is required to ""build a replacement CRM"" for Meals on Wheels providers between 2021 and 2023.
To do this, MMA first subcontracted a Canberra firm named Agile Digital but relations broke down and MMA stopped paying for its services. Some work on the CRM had been done and MMA allegedly took this to a new company named GoSource. A contract between the two was developed in November last year. A CRM has still not been delivered.","""By July <num> it was clear that MOWA did not have the required operational capability to engage directly with \[Meals on Wheels\] services, to implement Future Fit initiatives, nor manage operational software,"" the Miles Morgan final report says.

9562,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:
Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.
Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.
Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.
Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.
Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.
Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.
Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).
Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.
So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:
Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)
Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)
Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.
Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.
However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:
NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle
QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon
SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 
TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay
VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale
WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay
There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.","Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here: Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously).

Do you think that the times have remained unchanged? Society has evolved significantly, and it is essential to reconsider the focus of gender-centric schemes. These initiatives should now be targeted towards the specific sections of society that truly need them, rather than being broadly applied.

Recognizing the changing dynamics of our society is crucial. To ensure fairness and effectiveness, it is important to adapt our policies and programs to reflect the current realities. By focusing resources on those who truly need assistance, we can work towards achieving greater equity and inclusiveness. Additionally, continuous assessment and adjustment of these schemes can help address the evolving challenges faced by different sections of society.
I believe society has progressed to a stage where gender is no longer the primary ground for discrimination. Instead, financial capacity has become the more significant factor.

While there are always exceptions, this trend generally holds true.

You do see them around though. Sometimes parked. Sometimes driving around. Saw one the other day. They're almost always older cars selling for pretty low prices.
If the numbers have reduced in recent years it's probably because they're being listed on Facebook marketplace instead which doesn't cost you anything and is likely more effective. I sold my car via FBM. I paid for some advertising, I think it cost me $6. Sold it in 1 day.

9917,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world's third-largest population of sheep  behind China and India  but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don't have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems' capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.
The Coalition's usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country's transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.
A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow  ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn't rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?
The battery strategy sets out a ""vision"" over the next decade, in which Australia becomes ""a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition"".
We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers' know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!
The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.
Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated  note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.
Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.
There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.
The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.
The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.
Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.
Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.","One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add.

I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite. Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy <num>, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill. Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making. There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity. The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $<num> million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $<num> million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $<num> million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $<num> billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies. The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money. Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry. Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition."

Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 
Centrelink are useless. 
Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum's advocate. 
I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It's a nightmare!
Here are my pro-tips!
*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 
From memory it cost about $3500. 
They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 
*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 
You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 
Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 
I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 
I've just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let's not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 
*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 
Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it's surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 
Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 
Be your mum's advocate. That's the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It's enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 
That said, I've found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced.

10346,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.
Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"".
""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else.""
Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.
Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.
In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling.
""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?""
In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.
""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said.
In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.
In October 2022, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.
Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation.
Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.
Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.
""It wasn't a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister's office, and the pain of it hasn't gone away.""
""They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they're doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,"" says Dabboussy.","Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about <num> Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

9203,sarcasm,1,en-AU,Reddit,"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.
Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously.","You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain.

10138,sarcasm,1,en-AU,Reddit,"I'm sick of arguing with every opinionated ignoramus who hasn't made an effort to understand this case.
Firstly, if you are going to accuse me of wildly engaging in misinformation, it would be nice if you did me the courtesy of reading what I write until you comprehend it.
Both the judge and I distinguished between the cases deemed most comparable and those that were simply mentioned. One of the cases that was merely mentioned was about a lawyer stealing $220 000 from a disabled client (which is a lot worse than blowing the whistle), another that was merely mentioned was about stealing work tools. You've skimmed the conclusion of the judgment and cherry picked the least relevant and in one case most evil cases you could find.
I can't take you seriously if you pretend it's a coincidence the sentencing was held on budget day. That and the harshness of the sentence despite all the considerations I've listed are evidence of the judge's bias.
The Nazis obeyed orders and Stanislav Petrov disobeyed them, those are my points.
As his new lawyer will argue in court, he had duties that prevailed to the extent of any other duty. He could not have held his position as a military lawyer without having this duty. The proceedings in the High Court will shed light on this and most likely result in McBride being exonerated or at least given a better sentence for a whistle blower.
It's a lot easier to prove illegal procedures in investigating cases before you, than to prove cases of war crimes your superiors don't want you to see. If you look at the extracts of McBride's statements to police in the sentencing transcript, they will shed light on his motivations.
His previous lawyers took a very limited approach in defending David. Perhaps Mark Davis saw this case too much like a journalist (which he was) and that is why he didn't devote his time to making contingency plans in case his main argument was dismissed.
You are referencing the defense department investigating itselfwhen McBride concerns were with the leadership of the defense department.

CTE is definitely an issue in lots of sports. heading the ball in football, rugby (everything!), boxing, jockeys in horse racing. but what is the solution? most youngsters will still risk it.
I knew someone quite well who worked with an Australian NFL team and she told me the young guys who weren't big enough were told to go away and come back when they were bigger - however they managed to do that. and plenty of ways to get there if you're in gyms. doping is crazy prevalent now. she also worked with an AFL team and told me about the amount of recreational drugs they were taking, which finally came out in the media.
The show will go on because of $$$.","I'm sorry to hear about your dad. CTE was not so well understood back in the day, Welsh rugby player JPR Williams who played in the'70s said: ""The game was amateur, we only probably had physical contact once a week. Now they have it every day, the brain needs time to recover, it's like any organ in the body, it is quite a worry, it's repetitive, not even huge bangs but repetitive small injuries to the brain can be a problem in later life.""

The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).

9131,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. 
During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.
My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 
Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 
We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 
And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 
Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.
Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable.

No, we cannot make electrolysis more efficient than 1.6 units of electricity producing 1 unit of stored hydrogen energy.
* It requires 237kJ/mol to disassociate H2O into H2 and O2. \ That's the absolute theoretical minimum. 
* Burning hydrogen with oxygen releases 286kj/mol of heat energy \ 
* Thus, the theoretical maximum is requiring 1.2 units of electricity to produce 1 unit of stored hydrogen energy
* In practice, as the water electrolysis article will demonstrate, and the simple fact that heat engines are never 100% efficient (or we'd have 250% more energy from coal and gas-fired power stations than we do now), if we get 1.6:1 we're doing well.
* This ratio inevitably becomes worse because it requires energy to pressurise and refrigerate the hydrogen, since this requires 50kj/mol \
* and liquid hydrogen boils off during storage at a rate of 1-5%/day \[ibid\]
Again, it only makes energy sense if we have a massive surplus of renewable energy. But then if we have a massive surplus of renewable energy we don't need to store it, and don't have to store it in hydrogen or batteries, we can just waste it - unplug the solar PV, let the wind turbines spin without turning the turbines, and so on. 
It's simply a money-grab by mining companies from government, and a way to delay action on reducing fossil fuel consumption. Even nuclear is more sensible than hydrogen, and nuclear is a total subsidy suck which in around half the countries it's been instituted was a cover for a nuclear weapons programme.","The Space Shuttle was dealing with ordinary physical problems like two pipes making a good seal with each-other, and the fact that hydrogen atoms are so small they will actually leak out through a crystalline metal structure.

We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community.

On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.
""It's time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,"" he said.
Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.
""It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally  Israel  to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,"" Mr Leeser told The Australian. ""But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?"" ""This is not an environmental party,"" he said. ""This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.""
'What is Adam Bandt advocating for?': Labor MP questions Greens leader's announcement
Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.
Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not ""just a symbolic move.""
""It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,"" he said. ""It is a concrete step towards peace.""
""As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition."" Mr Bandt said the ""scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.""
""A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.""
He warned that a ""human engineered famine"" was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that ""amounts to collective punishment of these people.""
Mr Bandt said that Labor's credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you ""recognise just one side.""
""Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,"" he said. ""Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu."" Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting'un-Australian values'
Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.
""Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,"" Mr Watts said..
""Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,"" he said.
""Wedge politics only divides the community,"" he said. ""Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution  but the Greens aren't serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.""
""On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,"" he said. ""Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.""
But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. ""We see no role for them in this,"" he said. ""A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel's security.""
""We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority  We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.""
Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. 'End the occupation': Greens Leader calls for Labor to'take action' against Israel
""This motion  sends the message that Hamas' violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,"" he said. ""This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.""
He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women's rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the ""cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.""
Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had ""become a central plank of Green philosophy.""
""The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October  even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,"" he said. ""They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.""
Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC's Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.
Reflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed ""how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.""","NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the ""unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government.""

 Miners have poured a record $74bn into the coffers of federal, state and territory governments, with the Albanese government pocketing $42.5bn in company tax revenue, and Queensland and NSW cashing in on booming coal royalties.
After Jim Chalmers announced a second budget surplus anchored by strong mining exports and commodity prices, an EY royalty and company tax payments report, released on Monday, reveals miners have paid governments almost $360bn in taxes and royalties over a decade.
With Peter Dutton promising a Coalition government will adopt a ""pro-mining mindset"" and the Greens demanding an end to coal and gas, Anthony Albanese is under pressure to balance Labor's emissions reduction ambitions with support for traditional mining.
Commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia, whose members include BHP, Rio Tinto, Lynas Rare Earths, Glencore and Peabody, the annual report shows a $9.3bn increase in payments to governments. The $74bn payday for governments in 2022-23 included a decade-high $31.5bn in royalties. As well as traditional mining revenue associated with iron ore and coal, The Australian this month revealed oil and gas companies are on track to pay a record $17.1bn in taxes and royalties across 2023-24.
With the mining industry paying the highest average wages, contributing the most company taxes and delivering the bulk of export revenue, MCA chief executive Tania Constable warned against holding back miners with ""draconian 1970s industrial relations agendas, high energy, environmental, planning and taxation costs"". The MCA will launch a national advertising blitz on Monday.
""The recent federal budget revealed that government spending is on the rise and it is our country's mining sector that foots the bill, paying more than half of the company tax paid by large corporations and international businesses,"" Ms Constable told The Australian.
""Despite underwriting our nation's prosperity, living standards and security, the path forward for the mining industry remains uncertain. Our tax system is increasingly uncompetitive, and our regulatory environment is becoming more cumbersome.
""Approvals are taking too long, tied up in endless red tape, well-funded lawfare and multi-layered government bureaucracy, wasting taxpayers' money and holding back Australia's economy from realising its full potential.""
Queensland's share of national royalty payments increased from 32.5 to 47.2 per cent off the back of higher coal royalty rates, with NSW claiming a $4.7bn royalties windfall. In the battleground election state of Western Australia, iron ore remained the biggest earner despite lower revenue and prices in 2022-23.
""Total mineral sector royalties reached approximately $31.5bn in 2022-23, increasing by $7.6bn from the previous year. The yearly growth in royalties was primarily due to an increase of $7.1bn in royalty taxes paid in Queensland due to the introduction of progressive coal royalty rates,"" the EY report said.
""Western Australia's royalty income is largely attributed to iron ore. In 2022-23, iron ore production volumes were similar to 2021-22, so changes in WA's royalties were largely driven by changes in iron ore prices.
""Iron ore prices declined in the second quarter of 2022-23 and remained lower in early 2023 due to production restrictions in China.""
With mining companies and associated supply chains supporting 1.1 million jobs, Ms Constable said the sector was helping keep ""Australia solvent"".
""A robust mining sector is critical if we want to sustain public spending, advance Australia's broader economic agenda, and keep the budget in the black,"" she said. ""This is revenue that supports families, builds communities, and funds essential services like the NDIS, childcare subsidies and aged care."".
The mining industry has warned the Prime Minister that at a time of ""decaying productivity and looming long-term structural fiscal deficits, the government is imposing regressive policies on the sector that dampen the investment growth critical to achieving economic potential"".
Less than a year out from the election, Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton will ramp up campaigning in the resources-rich jurisdictions of WA and Queensland and the Northern Territory.
While Mr Albanese has used his Future Made in Australia policy to support critical minerals, Mr Dutton promised in his budget reply to cut red tape and rollback Labor's sweeping IR reforms.","Paywall Miners have poured a record $74bn into the coffers of federal, state and territory governments, with the Albanese government pocketing $<num>.5bn in company tax revenue, and Queensland and NSW cashing in on booming coal royalties.

8989,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.
In my opinion, if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public, you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process: that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation. We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.
If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.
I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.
I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.
Isn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?","Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.

9636,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.
Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry's services.
Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a ""limited-term contract"" in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads' licensing and registration arms  a deal due to expire in the 2060s.
The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was ""hoping to close any deal by the end of the year"".
A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria's bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.
A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.
""It can probably be done better,"" the minister said.
The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.
Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.
Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.
""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.""
The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.
Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.
The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.
Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.
But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.
Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.
Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.
""Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.""
Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"".
""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security  cybersecurity in particular  could quite quickly run into trouble.
""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.""
Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.
The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report.
The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.
It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.
The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.
Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.
The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.
Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.
When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.
""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time.
""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.""
The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria's coffers.
Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.
However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next 40 years.","The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.

When VicRoads was partly privatised in <num>, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation. ""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time. ""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets."" The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $<num> billion into Victoria's coffers. Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs. However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next <num> years."

Her statement is below to save you a click:
**Statement by Laura Tingle, 7.30 Chief Political Correspondent**
For much of the past two weeks, the political debate has focused not on the federal Budget but on the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply in which he pledged to cut migration to deal with the housing crisis.
I have written and broadcast on this decision and its implications on ABC platforms numerous times since then. I was also a panellist at the Sydney Writers' Festival on the weekend when migration and housing were also discussed in a panel on the year in politics.
In my writing and broadcasts over the past two weeks I have observed on several occasions that there were considerable dangers for the way our political discourse would unfold  and for social harmony  in linking migration to the housing crisis.
At the Writers' Festival I was asked to comment on the Opposition leader's policy on migration and the economy, including housing. Mr Dutton has been vocal on this topic, particularly over the past fortnight.
""It's not just housing,"" he said. ""People know that if you move suburbs it's hard to get your kids into school or into childcare. It's hard to get into a GP because the doctors have closed their books. It's hard to get elective surgery. These factors have all contributed to capacity constraints because of the lack of planning in the migration program.""
He has also said migrants are the cause of ""congestion on our roads"".
As the alternative Prime Minister, with an election approaching within a year, Mr Dutton's comments deserve rigorous scrutiny and examination.
I have also pointed out that there were flaws in the Opposition's position as a piece of viable policy. That is, while on the face of it an obvious answer to a shortage of housing might be to immediately try to cut the number of people seeking it  and the obvious answer there is migrants  things are actually a lot more complicated when you try to do that.
The Morrison government announced an almost identical cut in permanent migration numbers in the 2019 Budget, saying the ""planning level of the Migration Program will be reduced from 190,000 to 160,000 places for four years from 2019-20"". The pandemic rather disrupted that plan.
But the very same 2019 budget papers were forecasting that net overseas migration would be 271,700 in 2019 before dropping to just 263,800 three years later in 2022, despite the cut of 30,000 permanent places a year.
A big reason for the fact that net overseas migration was not forecast to fall, despite the cut in the permanent number, is that more than half the people who are accepted as permanent migrants are already here when they apply. So cutting permanent migration doesn't necessarily mean fewer people in, or coming to, the country. Some of the migration pool just changes ""class"". Others are still able to come here on temporary visas.
There has also been confusion about whether the Coalition planned to cut the (relatively small) permanent migration number, or to cut back the much larger, demand-driven net overseas migration number, which includes programs that have no formal caps and includes overseas students.
Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor added to that confusion last week when he said the plan was to cut net overseas migration by 25 per cent, not just permanent migration. Mr Taylor also accused Labor of using migration to prop up the economy  and it is true that the post-pandemic surge in returning temporary visa holders has indeed played a crucial role in keeping a barely simmering economy from dropping into recession. But that raises the question of what happens if you cut migration as dramatically as the Coalition appears to want to do.
Discussions at writers' festivals are much less formal and more free-flowing than a piece of analysis on an ABC platform and this was a format where adding detailed context to the discussion wasn't really possible.
Panellist Niki Savva had quoted those points Mr Dutton had made about too many migrants meaning things like it was too hard to buy a house, get in to see your GP, or get into childcare, and noted that the Opposition Leader seemed to bring everything back to immigration.
In agreeing with that observation, based on Mr Dutton's own quotes, I once again raised the risks for the political debate of a major political leader doing this, which I truncated as ""everything that's going wrong in this country is because of migrants"".
That was simply a result of trying to summarise a point in a much less structured forum and was not intended to imply he had said that verbatim. If I had been speaking on an ABC platform, or not in a five-way discussion, I would have provided all that context, as I do in my stories for the ABC.
I did indeed make the observation on Sunday that we are a racist country, in the context of a discussion about the political prospects ahead. I wasn't saying every Australian is a racist. But we clearly have an issue with racism. For some months now, for example, The Australian newspaper has been devoting considerable space to its alarm about a rise in anti-Semitism in Australia.
Without even going into the historic record, there is also ample evidence that racism remains a particular problem in our legal and policing systems. A coronial inquest underway in the Northern Territory has become mired in an expose of racism in the NT's elite policing unit. Racism and racial profiling repeatedly show up as an issue of concern in our policing and justice systems.
The morning radio news bulletins on the ABC on Monday featured several stories that were related to racism, including one about racial profiling of young South Sudanese men in a police presentation to legal practitioners in Melbourne.
Surveys, including by the ABC, have repeatedly found the majority of Australians of non-European backgrounds reporting experiences of discrimination and racism in their lives, sometimes starting as early as primary school.
Is it relevant to raise this record of Australian racism in political analysis? Absolutely, if it becomes an issue of controversy in our political contest  as it clearly did when Pauline Hanson appeared on the national stage in 1996 and declared the country was being ""swamped with Asians"". John Howard had similarly flirted with the issue of Asian immigration in the 1980s and Julia Gillard did too in 2013 when she used a speech on a visit to western Sydney to announce a clampdown on the issue of temporary skilled worker visas.
In my commentary at the ABC, and at the Sydney Writers' Festival, I expressed my concern at the risks involved in Peter Dutton pressing the hot button of housing and linking it to migration for these reasons.
Political leaders, by their comments, give licence to others to express opinions they may not otherwise express.
That does not make them racist.
But it has real world implications for many Australians.
Finally, panellists were asked to nominate a positive change that had come from the change of government, on the basis of the famous quote that ""when you change the government, you change the country"".
Not having the time in that setting to attempt a detailed and serious assessment of what has changed with the change of government, I made an off-hand observation that simply observed we now had fewer stunts like the ""needles in strawberries"" affair and that, whatever its failings, the current government seemed serious about policy.
I regret that when I was making these observations at the Writers' Festival the nature of the free-flowing panel discussion means they were not surrounded by every quote substantiating them which would have  and had  been included in what I had said earlier on the ABC.
This has created the opportunity for yet another anti-ABC pile-on.
This is not helpful to me or to the ABC. Or to the national debate
I am proud of my work as a journalist at the ABC, on all its platforms, and I let that work speak for itself.

1. The main reason is soil. Australia is a very old country, which means a lack of good volcanic soils over most of the country. Lack of phosphorus and sulfur.
2. There's water in the outback, in the Great Artesian Basin. And a huge number of rivers and lakes. Mostly dry, but that still means subsurface water.
3. Australian deserts are covered in vegetation, all of them. Australia's famous Nullarbor has no trees, but still have as much vegetation as the American west.
4. When the explorer Sturt reached the most isolated point in Australia, he was met by a tribe of Aborigines who greeted him with a masonic handshake and knew how to tie boots.

10959,sarcasm,0,en-IN,Reddit,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.
Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.
According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.
The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.
On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.
Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.","Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.

9088,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste. It's sourced from a small number of places, with a small number of providers. The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.
Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.
The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.
Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.","Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste.

It takes 3+ hours and the clothes never fully dried so I'd have to hang them out to finish drying anyway.

8993,sarcasm,0,en-AU,Reddit,"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.
""You actually can't have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn't begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,"" says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.
The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"".
To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.
""They're like, 'We can't get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people',"" says Huntley.
It's not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.
Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.
Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being ""swamped by Asians"". Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being ""swamped by Muslims"".
In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were ""out of control"".
""Was I right?"" she asked her fellow senators. ""You'd never admit it, but yes I was,"" she said.
It's hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.
It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is agood thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia's immigration intake.
Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.
Lowe was president of the country's pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10years until 2014.
During that time, he tells*The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to ""prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure"". The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be ""taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment"".
""Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer  The boost to government budgets is enormous.""
So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today  as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.
Meanwhile, Australia's population is on track to grow to about 40 million people  an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane  by 2060.","Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it. ""You actually can't have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn't begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,"" says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy <num> Degrees East. The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"". To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration. ""They're like, 'We can't get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people',"" says Huntley. It's not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration. Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of <num> of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March. Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in <num>, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being ""swamped by Asians"".

The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.
The only answer is unconditional love and respect.
Unless someone is physically abusive, in this case, you must stand up for yourself and the sake of other family members.","A lot of people of your age with hot blood will advise you to stand up for yourself and leave the house as soon as possible. Please don't do that. By leaving the house or fighting back, you will not solve anything. You are perhaps too young to understand a few things, and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful. Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage. I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor.

Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.
So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.
The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).
This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.
Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 
It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.
Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 
There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.
So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.","Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!
