I followed their advice for 8 years to treat depression, an autoimmune disorder and Costochondritis. All that happened was I got worse.

After <num> months of eating right, I went back for a check up. ALL of my symptoms are gone and I'm healthier than I've ever been. Cholesterol, BP, blood volume, hormone regulation, artery health etc are all the best they've ever been and all I did was stop eating most carbs, processed food and instead ate plenty of red meat. Wanting to help people is genuinely honourable and I appreciate their intent, but I don't really want to fund misinformation anymore. There are many people in my position who haven't been able to figure it out. It's time the health system got on board with actually improving health, with the help of real data, rather than merely selling products with studies paid for by the producers designed for maximum profit. I know people are going to whinge about this being pseudoscience and anecdotal but the result speak for its self and anyone who knows me can see the difference at at glance. The health industry is collapsing!"

The other room in the big room could just about fit a bed in and was a perfect square (it was around 250/month).

Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.
The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.
We really don't need policies giving loads of cash to wealthy old people who don't contribute to productivity.","It's because it includes payments from private pensions too.

A smackhead once flicked a lit ciggy end in my face, he was walking the opposite way so I turned ran up behind him and only after I closed the distance did I stop my self from punching him in the back of the head, likely breaking my hand and potentially killing him.
I've been in more than a few scraps, but I've rarely ever in my life been just that upset over something. I was pissed off because of having a ciggy flicked at me but that didn't compare to the days maybe even weeks after thinking about how bad that could have been. To do something so stupid. Not only was it terrifying and horrible to think I could have killed him but embarrassing to think that I'd ruin my life and hurt everyone around me over something like that.
That's a moment where I can say I truly grew up and if it had happened years before, as angry and aggressive as I could be towards people who I felt deserved it, I might have made the wrong choice.
Which is why I feel sorry for that young girl. If she has empathy then she doesn't need prison as she'll carry this for the rest of her life.","How sad for both involved.

I'd love to be able to assume that the police wouldn't set a dog on someone without good reason.
Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.
I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge. I think it's also plausible that a much larger proportion of police officers - probably most of them - would happily look the other way while that happened. I would expect this to be more likely if the guy had scorned the police officers involved, because they're extremely protective of their own hurt feelings, but that's another issue altogether.
I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.
The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it. If not, they should be charged with crimes and imprisoned like anyone else would be, and the fact that they are usually shown to be (to all practical purposes) immune from the criminal law is a large part of the problem.","This is really about the reputation of the police.

No one expects the broker to work for free. But you don't need a PhD in behavioural economics to understand that, if a service is chosen by a party which not only doesn't pay the bill, but gets a cut, then the result will be inflated prices.
The problem here is not that the broker gets a commission - it is that insurance commissions are shared between brokers and managing agents/freeholders. But the bill is paid by the leaseholders.
This creates an incentive to choose the more expensive policy, if it pays a higher commission.

The far more sensible strategy is to win power, demonstrate to left behind voters that the government is actually committed to helping them and can be trusted, and then explain why rejoining would offer this better than remaining outside. Unfortunately, that requires a lot of work. A lot of remainers care enough to tweet, but get quite bored at the prospect of actually coming up with a good solution for the parts of the country they don't actually give a shit about."

The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.
Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.
The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).
It was about 1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.
If anyone is interested, i am setting up a petition to deport the Conservative party to Rwanda, it probably won't happen, but it will give the civil service a laugh.

My petition:
Deport the entire Conservative party to Rwanda.
Send the Conservative party to Rwanda to enjoy their new life in the sun. If this isn't feasible, i would settle for just the Cabinet and Parliamentary Conservative party.
They are utterly useless.","As i understand it, our courts have ruled the scheme illegal because of Rwandas proven dodgy record on human rights.
