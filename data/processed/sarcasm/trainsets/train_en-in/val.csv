That scene was impersonification, mockery against Bala krishna's film scene. To our surprise, Hindi dubbing dept changed balakrishna into rajnikanth. If rajni kanth fans filed case on dubbing team, it would have been fair enough. Rajnikanth is a spiritual person, has high level of decency. It was unfair to drag his name in Hindi dub.  
Bala krishna need to be taught a lessons like this. He need to be mocked more in order to make his casteist fans apologetic, self-defensive for defending such moral-less actor. If your films are bad, then its tolerated, made fun but if you are feudal minded, then its not tolerated.","If any1 among Hindi guys, watched Hanu-man in Hindi dub, there is a scene where hero tests his powers against Train.

10791,sarcasm,0,en-IN,Reddit,"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves. The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.
Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.
This was just an irrelevant event for Isreali govt to care or interfere with, I think.","I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves.

The truth is that old kings and maharajas did whatever they could to maximize their powers. Even if it meant using religion or joining hands with the British.
Muslims literally went all the way to fight Ottoman Muslims under British rule.","Well because it doesn't help sell the narrative of anti ****** hate.

Also, once I have been to an astrologer he didn't even look up at my horoscope what he did was just hold my hand and told every secret thing that only I knew about my life...
